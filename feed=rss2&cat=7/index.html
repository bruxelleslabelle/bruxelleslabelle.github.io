				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/bake-window.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2042" src="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/bake-window-150x150.jpg" alt="bake window" width="150" height="150" /></a>BAKE is a small baking business run by Bérangère. She specialises in all things American (cookies, brownies and cakes, yum). And while she has no shop of her own, she sells her bakes at some of the city&#8217;s best coffee spots. And … she made bake-your-own cookie boxes, which I tried, tasted and loved!<span id="more-2041"></span></p>
<p>I first heard of BAKE when I visited Scandinavian interior and tea shop Hei. It&#8217;s one of the few spots where you can taste the delicious treats made by Bérangère. The other ones are APDM bagel bar, AMI, <a title="Chez Franz" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/p=1179">Chez Franz</a>, Vroom Vroom mobile coffee bar and Prélude. The last one, located in Saint-Gilles is where the BAKE headquarters are located, they share the same kitchen.</p>
<p>I was invited over earlier this week, an offer I couldn&#8217;t refuse. Those who know me know I loved to bake myself, so how could I refuse a peek into a professional kitchen? Bérangère introduced me to BAKE&#8217;s novelty for the Christmas season: a DIY box with all the ingredients to make chocolate chip cookies, the perfect gift for those with a sweet tooth. All you have to do is follow the recipe (included) and add butter and eggs.</p>
<p>I went home with a box and couldn&#8217;t wait to try!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Bake.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2043" src="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Bake.jpg" alt="Bake" width="653" height="653" /></a></p>
<p>Four pictures, it&#8217;s that easy! The recipe is for 12 large biscuits. I used half of everything to make 12 small ones, although they still turned out big. I&#8217;m not complaining. (And did you see how many chocolate chips there are?? They&#8217;re so good, and it&#8217;s hard to resist snacking on them while you&#8217;re waiting for the oven to heat up…)</p>
<p>The box costs 17 euro (if you pick it up at BAKE), 20 euro at Prélude, Hei or AMI.</p>

The Black Sheep behind Place Flagey has got both, and serves a mean burger to boot.<span id="more-2014"></span></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve visited The Black Sheep a couple of times now, and I felt a post was needed as the place got better every time.</p>
<p>On my first visit, my friends and I were after some comfort food and drinks on a rainy Sunday afternoon. We picked The Black Sheep, but had no idea what to expect. It&#8217;s definitely not your average English/Irish pub with wood cladded walls, carpet floors, Guinness memorabilia and &#8216;The Wild Rover&#8217; songs. The place is quite large actually, with seating available for just over 100 people at the same time. There&#8217;s a very large bar with well stocked fridges ( a varied choice of Belgian craft beers, the Brewdog UK range and much more). And, you can pay by card (hurray for that!)</p>
<p>First time there, we went for Fish &amp; Chips and a cocktail (or a fancy beer for the men). It did the trick. The place wasn&#8217;t very busy, but the staff were great, the cocktails were spot-on and the bill not too expensive.</p>
<p>One of the next visits was a Friday night. A completely different scene, with people dancing and very busy bar tenders. One of them suggested making me a &#8216;Tiramisu Martini&#8217;, which basically is a liquid dessert with cold coffee, cream and a fair bit of alcohol. Bonkers, but so good.</p>
<p>Our last visit definitely was the best one. Lured in by a new menu featuring burgers, chicken and fish and chips, my friends and I planned another trip on a Sunday evening. The ladies ordered cocktails (try the Bramble with gin and berry liqueur, 7,5 euro), the boys went for beers (try the Paix Dieu beer (10%), only brewed when there&#8217;s a full moon) and we ordered a platter of starters as well. Served on a wooden board, we got tempura vegetables with homemade dips, nacho crackers with cheese and mozzarella bread. The Black Sheep has a new chef who loves to make everything himself, which is great (and absolutely an upgrade from the usual pub grub).</p>
<p>We all ordered burgers (priced around 12 euro). The new menu has amongst others a classic version, the Ring of Fire (with chorizo) and the Jack Daniels (with whiskey marinated beef and bacon). Choosing is losing, and we all ended up with a different one. The buns (classic or rustic) were made with the chef&#8217;s own recipe and so was the meat. And the chips deserve a few lines of attention as well: they&#8217;re something in between potato wedges and french fries, deep fried in beef fat. Best (pub) fries ever!</p>
<p>To round up our greasy (but tasty!) Sunday, we got dessert as well. Vanilla ice cream fried in an oreo biscuit crust, a Ferrero Rocher mini muffin and a shot of Tiramisu Martini (hello again!). A bit much, but if you&#8217;re testing a new menu, you might as well do it right …. and we&#8217;ll definitely do it again.</p>
<p>Extra credits go to manager Chris and his team for making us feel very welcome and helping us pick the right food and drinks, the chef for choosing to make everything himself, and the playlist of the evening featuring a lot of Oasis.</p>
<p>Note: I snapped some pictures, but the evening light really didn&#8217;t do the food any justice.</p>
<p>Note2: Check The Black Sheep&#8217;s Facebook page for updates on parties, comedy nights, the new menu and much more.</p>
<p>8, Chaussée de Boondael, open Wed-Thu 17.00-01.00, Fri-Sat 17.00-03.00 and Sun 17.00-00.00</p>

Sweet, creamy, crusty … it put a big smile on my face! This delicious custard tart is available from the Portuguese bakery on Chaussée de Charleroi.<span id="more-1937"></span></p>
<p>For years in a row, Forcado (then called &#8216;Le Petit Forcado&#8217;) was nothing more but a tiny shop with a hidden kitchen, where the Portuguese baker would spend most of his day making several batches of the pastels. There was no space to sit down and enjoy the treats with coffee. But when you visited the bakery, the owner would happily step out of his kitchen and explain all about his little tarts.</p>
<p>Last summer, Forcado expanded to a larger space a couple houses further up Chaussée de Charleroi (across from <a title="King Kong" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/p=1962">King Kong</a>), run by the son of the Portuguese baker. There&#8217;s a big counter with a varied choice in patels (classic one, with speculoos, with coffee, with fresh raspberries or lemon). There are gluten free little cakes too, flavoured with chocolate and orange. All made at the old Forcado, and brought to the shop by the dad (on his slippers!)</p>
<p>They go really well with a nice cup of coffee and are dangerously more-ish!</p>
<p>Treats come at +/- 1,7 euro each, and are worth every cent.</p>
<p>-&gt; More Portuguese food? Try the cozy tea-room<a title="Jynga" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/p=1536"> Jynga</a> or shop wines and condiments at <a title="The Sol Ar Store" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/p=1038">Sol Ar</a>.</p>
<p>196-198, Chaussée de Charleroi, open from Tuesday until Sunday, between 10.00-18.00</p>

I thought it would be a tourist-y place, but it&#8217;s nothing like that (forgive me dear reader, I get it wrong sometimes).<span id="more-1998"></span></p>
<p>In fact, Ponti Corner is quite a large, and very pretty coffee bar/eatery with an outside terrace looking out to the Bourse building. Once inside, there&#8217;s a very large counter with fresh pastry and shelves packed with biscuits, jams and other treats, as well as ample seats and tables. At the back of Ponti, there are chesterfield sofas and more tables. There are magazines everywhere, books on interior design, chandeliers made with coffee cups and a great picture of Jack Nicholson.</p>
<p>The place looks great, and so does the menu. There&#8217;s breakfast (served until 11.30h), sandwich lunch, hot meals, dessert and treats and cocktails. Lots to choose from, but as it was (late) lunch time when we arrived, we sat down in one of the chesterfields and I ordered a toasted sandwich with ham on the bone and mature cheese. My friend went for the smoked salmon sandwich (both were beautifully presented and priced around 8 euro, which I must admit was a bit on the high side).</p>
<p>We had to wait quite a while before our lunch arrived (it wasn&#8217;t so bad in our case, as we had lots to chat about &#8211; but our neighbours at the table seemed to be less enthusiastic about having to wait that long). Once the food arrived, we tucked in right away. You can&#8217;t go wrong with a cheese toastie, and served with a tasty salad, it made for a nice lunch.</p>
<p>We didn&#8217;t stay for coffee, but the baked treats in the counter looked very tempting. We queued to pay and overheard the people in front of us complain about having to wait too long for their food as well. Growing pains, I hope, as Ponti Corner is a great addition to the city centre, whether you&#8217;re after breakfast, lunch, an afternoon break, afterwork drinks or pre-party cocktails!</p>
<p>41, Rue Henri Maus, open every day between 08.00-22.00</p>

It&#8217;s a cozy eatery with vegan, vegetarian and gluten free food, both sweet and savoury.<span id="more-1992"></span></p>
<p>I first visited Mémé Café a while ago. It was late afternoon, I was hungry and stumbled upon the place by accident. The sandwich I ordered was no longer available, but the owner suggested a great-sounding mix of whatever was left. While waiting for my sandwich to get toasted, I overheard him explaining all about his tea selection to a couple of ladies. Such passion and enthusiasm, it was lovely to see.</p>
<p>I paid for my sandwich, left and couldn&#8217;t wait to taste. The toasted bread was filled with caramelised onions, semi-dried tomatoes and roquette salad, a sweet, crunchy and salty mix that left my tastebuds happy for the rest of the day. (And made me regret not having ordered one of his banana and raspberry muffins).</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, a friend ordered her birthday cake at Mémé Café. Luck was on my side, it was a large banana, raspberry and chocolate cake! No gluten, no extra sugar, but deliciously moist and rich in flavour. Almost too good to be true.</p>
<p>When I was in the area again last week, I went back for a sandwich (and finally, a picture). It was lunch time, but not too busy (probably because it&#8217;s a bit off the beaten lunch track). I went for a feta cheese and tomato sandwich. The owner -still as enthusiastic as the first time- suggested adding some crunchy cabbage to it, which was a great idea (again).</p>
<p>I usually have my lunch on the go, but if you have time, I suggest you sit down for breakfast, brunch or lunch and take the time to enjoy all the homemade food. Besides sandwiches and sweet cakes or muffins, there are salads and quiches too.</p>
<p>Hmm, I&#8217;d love a banana muffin and a cup of coffee right now!</p>
<p>Note: Thanks Jyl and Michelle for suggesting a post on Mémé Cafe, happy to read you love this place too!</p>
<p>17 Rue des Riches Claires, open from Tue-Fri between 08.45-18.30 and on Sat from 10.00-19.00</p>

With good reason: Japanese ramen bar Kokuban is every bit as good as you&#8217;d expect. <span id="more-1981"></span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s always bustling at Kokuban, and it&#8217;s best to book a table. The menu mainly features delicious noodle dishes, served in a pretty white and blue bowl. There are some salads as well. But while waiting for your main dish, I suggest you spark your appetite with some gyoza. Filled with chicken and vegetables, these Japanese ravioli go down a treat. Or go for some crunchy Edamame (green beans).</p>
<p>The ramen are freshly made at Kokuban, and come served in a super tasty broth. I choose the Karaage ramen: crispy chicken, soy beans in a chicken and vegetable bouillon. Just perfect.</p>
<p>Go authentic and have some plum wine or (hot) saké with it .. or don&#8217;t, and have a glass of white wine (which I did).</p>
<p>If you fancy dessert afterwards, they serve amongst others Japanese flavoured ice cream (with green tea, black and white sesame) and almond pudding.</p>
<p>Eating at Kokuban is always a good idea, whether there&#8217;s just two of you or you&#8217;re dining with a larger group. And more good news: main courses are priced between 12 and 18 euro!</p>
<p>Note: The food was so nice I forgot to snap a picture. The one in this post is from the Kokuban website.</p>
<p>53-55, Rue Vilain XIIII, Ixelles, open every day but Sunday between 12.00-14.00 and 19.00-22.00</p>

Boring, but it does the trick. On my (rare) days off, I&#8217;d love to discover something new. And the rice paper rolls at Knees to Chin were the perfect change from my routine.<span id="more-1975"></span></p>
<p>The small eatery in the Bailli-Chatelain area opened recently and is entirely dedicated to Vietnamese rice paper rolls. They come with a couple of different fillings, sauces and side dishes.</p>
<p>The day I sat down for lunch, I could choose between pork, scampi, duck or chicken. All rolls were priced at 3,80 euro. As it was lunch time, you could opt for the 8 euro meal deal, which includes two rolls and a bowl of rice or cabbage salad. I didn&#8217;t go for it though, and picked two rolls: one with chicken, one with scampi.</p>
<p>My friend and I sat outside -inside was packed, always a good sign- and were served a couple minutes after ordering. We got an explanation of what sauce to have with each of the rolls and tucked in.</p>
<p>The rolls were quite large and generously filled. The chicken one came with crunchy leaves, noodles, fried onions and a peanut sauce. The scampi one also had mint an mango wrapped in it, and came with a light avocado sauce. Both were delicious. Light, but filling. My friend said the same was true for the duck one.</p>
<p>We couldn&#8217;t stay for dessert and coffee unfortunately. But do try the cake when you&#8217;re there, it looked delicious!</p>
<p>Note: everything is available for take-out too.</p>
<p>125 Rue de Livourne, Ixelles, Monday until Friday between 11.30-21.30, Wednesday 11.30-15.00 and Saturday 12.00-18.00</p>

I had heard and read great things about the place, so I walked in with high expectations. I liked it, but didn&#8217;t leave raving about it, as others seemed to do.<span id="more-1967"></span></p>
<p>You&#8217;ll find the eatery down Rue Marché aux Poulets, a couple of houses away from coffee roasters <a title="Corica" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/p=109">Corica</a> and fish &amp; chips joint <a title="Bia Mara" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/p=1343">Bia Mara</a> (whose owners helped set up Peck 47). There&#8217;s a big black board with quotes and parts of the menu outside, as well as some tables and seats (unfortunately, the street isn&#8217;t the most cozy of the centre).</p>
<p>Inside, I loved the decor. Sit down at the table or the comfy sofa, a friendly member of staff will bring the menu. Around lunch time, there are mainly salads (around 8 euro) or sandwiches to choose from. I ordered The Pecker (chicken sandwich), my friend The Italian (with salami). While waiting for our order, we picked a drink from the counter. That left us a little disappointed,  as it stocked nothing we hadn&#8217;t seen before (San Pellegrini lemonades, Tao drinks, Bolbu chocolate milk, …) We probably should have gone for a pitcher of Pimm&#8217;s, but work had to be done in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Our sandwiches came after a few minutes, served on a wooden board with a small soup. That was a nice surprise, it tasted great. The sandwich itself was ok, but white baguettes …. I don&#8217;t know. I think it would have tasted better with darker bread.</p>
<p>We left, paying 7,5 euro for a lunch (sandwich and a tao) that kept us full all afternoon. Full, but not raving. Maybe we should go back and try their breakfast or brunch? Anyhow, Peck 47 is now on my &#8216;to visit again&#8217; list.</p>
<p>47, Rue Marché aux Poulets, open every day from 08.30-20.00 (weekends open as of 11.00)</p>

King Kong settled down a couple of weeks ago, a Peruvian snack bar with a stunning decor.<span id="more-1962"></span></p>
<p>The main speciality on the menu is chicken. But somehow I was more temped by the hamburguesa (pictured): a crusty bun with a tasty burger, avocado, lettuce and a semi-spicy sauce. We ordered yuca chips and a side salad with it, and they were both a real treat. The former came with a pale sauce, of which I can&#8217;t come up with any other description than &#8216;nice&#8217;. Nothing more. The latter deserves a lot of credit, as it mixed tomatoes, salsa, quinoa, all sorts of beans and leaves. One of the best salads I&#8217;ve had in a while.</p>
<p>Upon my second visit -yes, I went twice already- I ordered the cold &#8216;pollo con mayonesa&#8217; sandwich. Which basically is a chicken mayo sandwich, but again with avocado and a special sauce. I liked it a lot too, and noticed that the size of the buns had about doubled since my last visit!</p>
<p>You order and pay at the counter, where you can see your food being cooked. There are quite a few tables, from cozy corners with wicker vintage chairs, to long wooden tables. The interior features lots of wood, dark green paint and plants everywhere (I loved the hanging baskets). At the back, there&#8217;s a great looking garden too with rocky wall. Unfortunately you can&#8217;t sit outside (yet).</p>
<p>Great place, great food.</p>
<p>227, Chaussée de Charleroi, open every day 12.00-15.00 &amp; 19.00-22.30 (Mon &amp; Sun, lunch only)</p>

Add great service, a bit of a nostalgic vibe and Belgian artwork on the walls … and you get Au Vieux Saint-Martin.<span id="more-1931"></span></p>
<p>The house speciality is &#8216;filet américain&#8217;, made with the original recipe from the 1920s, invented by the chef&#8217;s grandfather. It comes with hand chopped fries and homemade mayonnaise, and as you could have guesses, is an absolute treat.</p>
<p>Other classics include vol-au-vent (chicken stew in a creamy sauce), rabbit in cherry beer and sausages and potato mash. All served on a plate with the brasserie&#8217;s logo. It&#8217;s a small touch, but just like everything else at Au Vieux Saint-Martin, it makes the difference.</p>
<p>We arrived around 20.00 on a Saturday evening. The place was packed and we were after a table for eight. Making reservations is impossible, but the staff are used to the hustle and bustle, and managed to free a large table within fifteen minutes. We spent that time sipping a drink at the bar, with a view on the kitchen.</p>
<p>We all chose something different to eat, but everything arrived at the same time. Our wine glasses were topped every now and again, and waiters came to check if everything was ok. That&#8217;s good service!</p>
<p>With the average dish costing over 20 euro, the food at this brasserie is more expensive than elsewhere. But in my opinion, it was all very much worth it.</p>
<p>38 Grand Sablon, open every day from 10.00-00.00 (kitchen opens at 12.00)</p>
