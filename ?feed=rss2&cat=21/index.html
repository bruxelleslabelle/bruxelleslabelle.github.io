And down Rue Vanderkindere, <a title="Zizi" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/%3Fp=382">Glacier Zizi</a> and Il Gelato are stiff competitors. When one day, the queue at Zizi really was way too long, I joined the shorter queue at Il Gelato.<span id="more-1834"></span></p>
<p>And I wasn&#8217;t disappointed. The choice of Italian ice cream flavours was huge, the scoops generous and the taste delicious. I opted for dulce de leche and moka, just perfect.</p>
<p>Il Gelato opened first in 1990 and has expanded a fair bit since, with a booth in both Westland and Woluwé Shopping centre, and a parlour outside Brussels in Louvain-La-Neuve.</p>
<p>They serve large ice cream concoction too, such as the &#8216;Bounty Coupe&#8217; with coconut and chocolate or &#8216;Fragolona&#8217; with vanilla and strawberry ice cream topped with lots of strawberries.</p>
<p>168 Rue Vanderkindere, open every day between +/- 10.00-23.00</p>

<p>Brussels didn&#8217;t have its own Ikea until a few years ago, so I was never really tempted to go and visit the shop. I&#8217;m never really tempted these days either &#8211; to be honest -but when people ask if I want to come, I don&#8217;t say no.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if I could ever buy big furniture from the shop, but I&#8217;ve become quite handy at throwing small things in the big blue bag. On my list of favourites: a set of wooden coat hanger, scented candles, slippers, muffin liners, a box of &#8216;kex&#8217; biscuits, &#8230; and of course, a handful of those wooden crayons.</p>
<p>I very much enjoy looking around, though. Everything is put together or stacked in such a clever way. The things displayed on one square meter, unbelievable. But I try not to get too carried away, and usually make a list to avoid buying too much (wish is something I should probably do when clothes shopping too).</p>
<p>There&#8217;s one thing I always bulk buy, simply because I can&#8217;t find it anywhere else: the elderflower juice boxes, called Dryck Fläder. Yum.</p>
<p>1432 Chaussée de Mons, open every day but Sunday, 10.00-20.00 (&gt;21.00 on Friday)</p>
