Some of them are ugly, some delicate, some kitsch … If you&#8217;ve had enough of that, Le Typographe sells a great alternative: quality paper ones with a simple print, handmade in Brussels.<span id="more-1926"></span></p>
<p>The shop and &#8216;factory&#8217; are located in a big mansion in Ixelles. There&#8217;s classical music playing in the background, and paper and stationary items on shelves and tables.</p>
<p>During the holidays, the greeting cards are the most popular. Printed with an old Heidelberg letter press, they come in a couple of sizes and colours. If you&#8217;re going for something unique, you can make your own by choosing paper, envelopes and draw or write your own design (the choice is overwhelming), or go for a special print and ask the staff at Le Typographe for help.</p>
<p>The shop is perfect for last-minute gift picking as well. From notebooks, to do-lists and calendars (all made in-house) to fancy writing pens and pouches to store your pencils.</p>
<p>And while it might be too late to buy this year&#8217;s Christmas cards and have them sent on time, think about Le Typographe for next year (or any upcoming birthday). You can&#8217;t go wrong with <em>made in Brussels.</em></p>
<p>67 Rue Américaine, open from Monday until Friday between 13.00-18.00, Saturday from 11.30-18.00</p>

<p>Shop owner Pascaline loves all things graphic. She creates her own prints too, and has them printed on t-shirts and sweaters, available for men, women and kids.</p>
<p>Besides clothing, there&#8217;s a lot more to discover. Some of my favourite items were the coffee cups with black and white design, the diamond shaped china boxes, the metal baskets and the wooden cabin. The last one was designed for children, but is available for grown-ups too.</p>
<p>As of January 2014, Pacaline will organise creative workshops too. On Sunday afternoons, children can learn how to make their own graphic design and have it printed on a t-shirt. Adults in need of design inspiration can ask Pascaline for help too, from the creation of your business cards to the invitation to your next party.</p>
<p>Cool shop!</p>
<p>72 Rue du Page, open from Wednesday until Saturday between 11.30-18.30</p>

It belongs to Pika Pika Japan, a new shop selling toys, items and clothes all the way from Japan. <span id="more-1856"></span></p>
<p>A while ago, there was a similar shop with the same name (and by the same owner) down Rue Lombard in the city centre. I never walked in the shop, but the day I was planning to do so, it was shut. When walking on Chaussée de Waterloo one day, (on my way to <a title="Bang Bang" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/p=665">Bang Bang</a>, to be precise), I noticed this new shop and walked in right away.</p>
<p>Lots of colours, lots of shapes, lots of cute little toys staring at you with big eyes. Inflatable animals, notebooks, mobile phone pendants, socks, piggy banks, stickers, markers &#8230; an incredible selection of Japanese stuff. If you&#8217;re not sure what you&#8217;re looking at, the owner and the shop assistant have tons of stories to tell.</p>
<p>I loved the little green and orange bird that tweeted every now and again, when  somebody walks passed it. But eventually left the shop with a bright red Kewpie, a plastic adorable little figurine, with wings and big eyes. It doesn&#8217;t do anything, but when I look at it, I cannot but smile.</p>
<p>Note: Everything is directly imported from Japan, which explains the price. Nothing it too expensive, though.</p>
<p>525 a, Chaussée de Waterloo, open every day but Sunday, between 11.00-19.00</p>

It&#8217;s called Kure and sells a mix of great Scandinavian and French brands, lovely accessories, industrial furniture and art. <span id="more-1817"></span></p>
<p>Multi-brand shops are my favourites. There&#8217;s a little bit of everything and they&#8217;re the perfect place to discover new labels.</p>
<p>Kure opened where the old G-Star shop was, in an old, huge building with two floors, bare brick walls and white ceilings. Amongst the many brands, a couple of great names such as Vanessa Bruno and American Retro. A few labels I had heard of before but never tried myself, such as Hope and Margaux Lonnberg and a couple of names that were completely new to me such as Anine Bing and Ganni.</p>
<p>The style of the clothing is very cool and temporary. Think of white tops and t-shirts, sweaters, black skinny trousers and leather jackets. There are some on-trend pieces as well, such as a checked woollen oversized coat, royal blue fluffy jumpers or flat leopatd boots.</p>
<p>I was very happy to see Kure stocked Fashionology as well, a Dutch jewellery label. Affordable rings, necklaces and bracelets, I had checked out on their website before but never made up my mind. I went home with a small selection of my favourite pieces, and have the feeling my collection will grow soon.</p>
<p>The shop has a little garden too, where you can sit down, read magazines or have a drink.</p>
<p>Note: only women&#8217;s clothing at the moment, but there will be stuff for men as well.</p>
<p>48 Rue Antoine Dansaert, open Monday until Saturday, between 10.30-19.00</p>

<p>The shop is open since 1983 and at the moment, it&#8217;s being expanded from 1.700 square metres to a whopping 2.600 square metres. More space for more books!</p>
<p>I especially love the large rack with international magazines, the art books, the cookery books, the stationary corner and the coffee spot (where they serve sandwiches and snacks too).</p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing you can&#8217;t find at Filigranes. And if whatever you&#8217;re looking for really isn&#8217;t available in store, they&#8217;ll be happy to order it for you. And should it all become too much, there even is a defibrillator in the shop. I mean. &#8230;</p>
<p>Note: there are two small Filigranes in Brussels too, at Parvis Saint-Pierre in Uccle or on Rue Lepoutre in Ixelles. But nothing beats a visit to the big one.</p>
<p>39-40, Avenue des Arts, open every day between 08.00-20.00 (weekends: 10.00-19.00)</p>

And while I really don&#8217;t need anything at all (in fact, the one thing I truly do need would be an extra wardrobe), I will probably have a look at all my favourite shops to see if they have anything left from my wishlist, in my size (and at a stiff discount).<span id="more-1765"></span></p>
<p>As summer kicked in late (euphemism), I&#8217;m guessing all shops will have a huge stock left. And even though some have already started clearing their stock room via private sales over the last few weeks, the official sales only start on Monday July 1.</p>
<p>Uptown I&#8217;ll pop into the new <a title="Village Verve" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/p=1598">Village Verve</a> to check if they still have that gorgeous Dagmar summer dress in my size. On my way to Avenue Louise, I&#8217;ll check what <a title="No Concept" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/p=44">No Concept</a> has to offer, followed by <a title="Louise 54" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/p=1065">Louise 54</a>. I love that shop for their great selection, but obviously I can&#8217;t afford most of what they sell. Sales times are different though, we&#8217;ll see.</p>
<p>I usually end up in <a title="Zara Home" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/p=684">Zara Home</a> as well, stocking up on candles and peculiar coffee cups (I seem to have started a collection). I avoid the high-end boutiques on Boulevard de Waterloo, but will have a peek at <a title="Autour du Monde" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/p=1115">Bensimon&#8217;s</a> and the Kenzo boutique (love their knitwear) down Rue de Namur.</p>
<p>After all this, I guess a lunch/coffee break is in order. The new <a title="Jat’ Café" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/p=1696">Jat&#8217; Café</a> could be the ideal location to rest my legs for a bit, before walking down to the shops around Dansaert.</p>
<p>In the city centre, <a title="Icon" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/p=632">Icon</a> is on top of my list. I&#8217;m not eyeing anything in particular, but during sales I always spot things I didn&#8217;t see throughout the season. <a title="Hunting and Collecting" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/p=508">Hunting and Collecting </a>will get a visit too, for the same reason (and perhaps another Carven skirt, love them). And I&#8217;ll check Espace Bizarre for more home deco, because I like everything they have in store.</p>
<p>Probably followed by another coffee break at <a title="AM Sweet" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/p=334">AM Sweet</a>.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the plan, but I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ll be popping in and out of many other boutiques as well. What about you?</p>

So when my dear iphone&#8217;s microphone stopped working, I was in trouble.<span id="more-1756"></span></p>
<p>I went to the shop where I bought it, where I was told it would take minimum 3 weeks. I was entitled to a replacement phone (no smart phone), but that wasn&#8217;t good enough an offer. The Apple repair service at Cami would need at least a week, which didn&#8217;t sound ideal either. A desperate tweet later, a follower (thanks!!!) informed me of a new smart phone repair shop on Place Chatelain, located in the White Night store.</p>
<p>I was a bit sceptical (why would a repair shop be located in a day/night shop?) but headed over there the next day. You need to walk down the stairs of the shop, where a team of young technicians awaits your broken smartphone. They asked me a couple of questions, promised the problem could easily be solved and that it would be ready in 15 minutes. (Their tag line says &#8216;ready in an hour&#8217;, so I was a bit sceptical (again, yes)).</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no possibility to pay with your card (yet), so I walked up to the nearest ATM, and by the time I got back my phone was fixed!</p>
<p>Yes, I did have to pay 60 euro, but I only had to miss my phone for a couple of minutes, which is a fair deal.</p>
<p>They repair most smart phones and tablets, and if they have the spare parts in stock, you&#8217;ll have your gadget fixed in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>Kudos to the young guys who set up this business. They found the gap in the market and the shop in Ixelles is the second one (the other one is in Waterloo), others may follow soon.</p>
<p>43 Place du Chatelain, open from Monday until Friday between 12.00-20.00</p>

<p>The orange Eames look-a-like (at 105 euro, I don&#8217;t think it could have been a real one) lured me into the shop. It&#8217;s only a small place, but there are a lots of tables, chairs, sofas and lamps to choose from. Some instantly remind you of a hotel, others were clearly picked by somebody with a keen eye on modern design. If you&#8217;re after bar stools for instance, this would be a good shop to find some.</p>
<p>All items come from hotels in and around Brussels as well as France and the UK. And if you&#8217;re looking for something in particular, they&#8217;re more than happy to help you out. (Their warehouse is packed with beds and bedding, office furniture &#8230; too)</p>
<p>200, Rue Edith Cavell, open from Monday until Saturday, between 11.00-18.30 (14.30 on Mondays)</p>

It might be quite a trek to get there, but the choice, great prices and super friendly owners make more than up for that.<span id="more-1634"></span></p>
<p>The shop is run by Nathalie and Lucie. While the former is a fan of all things antique, the latter prefers the 70s. They both search high and low (from antique markets to people&#8217;s basements) for the best items at the best price. As they love browsing, they have an enormous stock of furniture and deco which they&#8217;d like to rotate as quickly as possible. As a result, everything you buy at L&#8217;Atelier des Marquises comes with a very acceptable price tag.</p>
<p>I loved their range of cute coffee tables, from a yellow one from the 60s to a tiled one from the 70s. Magazine racks, vintage cups and plates, old wooden chairs and sofas, the place is packed with treasures from the past. In the future, the ladies plan courses where they&#8217;ll teach you how to freshen up old furniture. Clever idea.</p>
<p>Note: I took the picture from the shop&#8217;s Facebook page, as I simply forgot to take one while I was there. That&#8217;s how much I enjoyed the shop!</p>
<p>98 Rue Middelbourg, open from Wednesday until Saturday, between 10.30-18.30 and on Sundays between 10.30-14.30</p>

There&#8217;s <a title="La Meute" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/p=1542">La Meute </a>in Ixelles for instance, and now the city centre has it own shop of wonders too. In the old, renovated fire brigade on Place du Jeu de Balle, House of Wunders stores all sorts of mineral fossils, coral, fossilised wood etc. <span id="more-1618"></span></p>
<p>First of all, the shop on its own is stunning. A very high ceiling, a sort of mosaic black and white floor, and of course, shiny minerals everywhere.</p>
<p>Owner Siobhan told me all about where they come from, how old they are (millions of years), a little bit about their powers (but not too much), and with clippings from magazines, illustrated how they can be used to decorate your house and much more. Before I knew it, an hour had gone past. I felt a bit like a 9 year old in a museum, only this time, I could touch everything in the shop.</p>
<p>If you are in the area, pop in. It will be an amazing discovery of some of Mother Nature&#8217;s oldest remains.</p>
<p>76 Place du Jeu de Balle, open on Tuesday until Sunday, between +/- 10.00-18.00</p>
