And down Rue Vanderkindere, <a title="Zizi" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/%3Fp=382">Glacier Zizi</a> and Il Gelato are stiff competitors. When one day, the queue at Zizi really was way too long, I joined the shorter queue at Il Gelato.<span id="more-1834"></span></p>
<p>And I wasn&#8217;t disappointed. The choice of Italian ice cream flavours was huge, the scoops generous and the taste delicious. I opted for dulce de leche and moka, just perfect.</p>
<p>Il Gelato opened first in 1990 and has expanded a fair bit since, with a booth in both Westland and Woluwé Shopping centre, and a parlour outside Brussels in Louvain-La-Neuve.</p>
<p>They serve large ice cream concoction too, such as the &#8216;Bounty Coupe&#8217; with coconut and chocolate or &#8216;Fragolona&#8217; with vanilla and strawberry ice cream topped with lots of strawberries.</p>
<p>168 Rue Vanderkindere, open every day between +/- 10.00-23.00</p>

I&#8217;m not too keen on their baby blue interior, but their menu is delicious and I entirely agree with their tag line &#8216;All you feed is love&#8217;.<span id="more-1822"></span></p>
<p>On the menu: a list of suggestions ranging from an organic salad to a burger or grilled fish. Lots of sweet treats too, with their &#8216;no butter, no sugar&#8217; chocolate cake as a best-seller.</p>
<p>As it was a sunny day when I visited B &amp; S, I opted for the organic salad. I was served a generous portion of several mixed salads. Amongst others: apple and celery, quinoa, courgette with a lovely dressing, spicy rice and a lovely chunk of goat&#8217;s cheese. Very filling, which unfortunately meant I couldn&#8217;t choose dessert. I was quite tempted by the apple tarte tatin, I have to say.</p>
<p>B &amp; S serves breakfast too, with anything from Danish pastry to homemade muesli. Every third Sundday of the month is brunch time (at 25 euro). And nearly everything is available for take-out too.</p>
<p>Note: I took the picture from the B &amp; S website.</p>
<p>178 Rue Edith Cavell, open from Monday until Friday, from 8.30-17.00 (Sunday brunch between 11.00-15.00)</p>

<p>The shop is open since 1983 and at the moment, it&#8217;s being expanded from 1.700 square metres to a whopping 2.600 square metres. More space for more books!</p>
<p>I especially love the large rack with international magazines, the art books, the cookery books, the stationary corner and the coffee spot (where they serve sandwiches and snacks too).</p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing you can&#8217;t find at Filigranes. And if whatever you&#8217;re looking for really isn&#8217;t available in store, they&#8217;ll be happy to order it for you. And should it all become too much, there even is a defibrillator in the shop. I mean. &#8230;</p>
<p>Note: there are two small Filigranes in Brussels too, at Parvis Saint-Pierre in Uccle or on Rue Lepoutre in Ixelles. But nothing beats a visit to the big one.</p>
<p>39-40, Avenue des Arts, open every day between 08.00-20.00 (weekends: 10.00-19.00)</p>

Tea shop <a title="Thé-rapy" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/%3Fp=1639">Thé-Rapy</a> for instance, florist Thierry Boutemy&#8217;s new boutique, there&#8217;s a caviar shop too, and very recently, a new deli opened its doors as well. It&#8217;s called Heyndrickx &#8216;the way to good life&#8217;.<span id="more-1773"></span></p>
<p>The shop is run by Mr and Mrs Heyndrickx, and if I got it correctly, he imports all sorts of products and she decided to step into the &#8216;sales world&#8217; as well by opening a deli shop. They decided to sell all the brands they love, some regional specialities, a few luxury condiments and treats from other countries.</p>
<p>What I loved most about the shop, is that it sells different things than elsewhere. The English label Cottage Delight, for instance, which has delicious jams and marmalades, biscuits and sauces, or the French Le Comptoir de Mathilde, with its range of chocolate spreads and sweets.</p>
<p>Regional products include honey gingerbread (from a beekeeper near where I grew up), juices from organic farms, gruut (beer without hops) and geuze from breweries just outside Brussels.</p>
<p>And while the front of the shop is packed with food, the back is all about drinks. Wines and spirits, beers, flavoured rums and more.</p>
<p>My catch of the day: some gruut, a loaf of honey gingerbread, a couple of chunks of nougat and chocolate spread made with olive oil. All very, very tasty.</p>
<p>The shop stocks some gluten free and sugar free products too, there are some fresh products as well (cheese for instance) and the range will vary as the seasons change.</p>
<p>Rue Vanderkindere 378-380, open Tuesday to Saturday, from 10.00-18.00</p>

Owners Melanie and Daniel try to offer products without nasty chemicals, but only on the condition they truly work.<span id="more-1705"></span></p>
<p>The shop has been open since the start of 2013, but I never made it there until recently. It&#8217;s located in Fort Jaco, an area not usually on my &#8216;wander about&#8217; path. But it&#8217;s a good idea to venture out there every now and then, and visit Freshlab for instance (also, located straight across from <a title="No Concept Market" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/%3Fp=983">No Concept Market</a>).</p>
<p>Freshlab stocks some great perfume brands, such as Odin, Miller Harris and Bond No 9. I found it very difficult to pick a favourite, and describing my favourite smell didn&#8217;t help either, as I had no clue how to start.</p>
<p>On to cosmetics then. Nail varnish in all colours by Kure, the only one without formaldehyde. Or soap by Les Savonneries Bruxelloises, their black rose soap blocks smell divine! Hair care comes in bottles labelled Philip B, the Hollywood hairdresser. With luxurious ingredients such as white truffle and mysterious names as Russian amber, the hair lotions have become many women&#8217;s favourite. For everyday facial creams, there&#8217;s the well known brand Ren (another of my favourites), and for a treatment during the weekend, they sell Glamglow, which is supposed to give you sexy skin.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot more available in the shop, and the range keeps expanding. You get great advice, aren&#8217;t pushed into buying and get a set of samples to try at home!</p>
<p>Note: If you love the &#8216;healthy cosmetics&#8217; approach, but find Uccle a bit far, try <a title="La Feuille" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/%3Fp=152">La Feuille</a> near Place Brugmann or <a title="Beauty by Kroonen &amp; Brown" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/%3Fp=1436">Beauty by Kroonen and Brown</a> in the city centre.</p>
<p>1482 Chaussée de Waterloo, open from Monday until Saturday, between 10.30-18.30</p>

<p>Al Piccolo Macone -or Le Petit Macon, located next to brasserie Le Macon- is a tiny pizza place. The counter and big oven take up most of the place, however there are some tables and seats available to eat in (including some on the terrace outside).</p>
<p>On the menu: pizza in true Italian style. The cook tosses the dough into the air before piling it with the ingredients of your choice. A couple of minutes in the oven later, my pizza Napoli was boxed up. 7,50 euro for a crispy pizza topped with tomato sauce, capers, anchovies, black olives and cheese, not bad at all (a million times better value than the frozen one I was initially going for).</p>
<p>The pizzeria does home deliveries too, and you can order via the website. Dangerously comfortable. (Next one I&#8217;d like to try, their pizza Regina!)</p>
<p>354 Rue Vanderkindere, open between 18.00-22.30</p>

<p>The orange Eames look-a-like (at 105 euro, I don&#8217;t think it could have been a real one) lured me into the shop. It&#8217;s only a small place, but there are a lots of tables, chairs, sofas and lamps to choose from. Some instantly remind you of a hotel, others were clearly picked by somebody with a keen eye on modern design. If you&#8217;re after bar stools for instance, this would be a good shop to find some.</p>
<p>All items come from hotels in and around Brussels as well as France and the UK. And if you&#8217;re looking for something in particular, they&#8217;re more than happy to help you out. (Their warehouse is packed with beds and bedding, office furniture &#8230; too)</p>
<p>200, Rue Edith Cavell, open from Monday until Saturday, between 11.00-18.30 (14.30 on Mondays)</p>

On the windows, you can see Sigmund Freud sip from a pink cup of tea. There are plenty of flavours to choose from, to suit your every mood.<span id="more-1639"></span></p>
<p>The tea is stored in big red tins, and is branded Lindfield (a label I&#8217;d never heard of before. It&#8217;s from Brittany). Owner Katie always wanted to run her own tea shop, but never really got round to it. Until she turned 50 and decided to go for it after all.</p>
<p>Great idea, I think. As there wasn&#8217;t really a tea shop/room in the area. Unfortunately, administrative paperwork take their time, which means Thé-rapy is still awaiting its tea room permission. But if you&#8217;re in the area, let nothing stop you from visiting the shop and pick a bag of loose tea leaves for a brew at home. Tried, tested and very much approved: Irish Cream and Vanilla Rooibos. Sweet and flavourful, a nice change from all the coffee I drink.</p>
<p>Thé-rapy comes with a little &#8216;treats corner&#8217; as well, including biscuits and chocolates, pretty shaped sugar cubes, jams and jellies and the like.</p>
<p>214 Rue Vanderkindere, open from Tuesday until Saturday, between 10.00-18.30</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Picard.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1407" title="Picard" alt="" src="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Picard-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a>Nearly every French person I know is raving about Picard, a French frozen food chain store. They opened their first shop in Woluwe a while ago, a bit out of the way &#8230; but two weeks ago, they opened in the Bascule area too. So I took my freezer bag out for a walk!<span id="more-1406"></span></p>
<p>We all know the empty fridge syndrome. It usually pops up at the end of the week or -even worse- during the weekend. If you&#8217;re lucky, there&#8217;s something edible lingering in the freezer&#8230;. but I must admit that the frozen food isle is one I usually avoid in the supermarket. (small freezer, can&#8217;t be bothered, etc).</p>
<p>But with so many people raving about Picard, I just had to check it out. I made some space in my mini freezer, and off I was. The shop in Uccle is only small, but you&#8217;d be surprise how much food goes into those big white freezers. Vegetables, fruit, soup mixes, ready-made soup, fish, meat, ready-made meals &#8230; everything! You can even buy your entire Christmas dinner there, frozen of course (canapés, starter and dessert included!)</p>
<p>I was a bit overwhelmed by the many freezers. While shopping, an elderly man was reading everything out loud, so I perfectly knew what to expect from the next freezer. I tried to make a practical selection, and went for a bag of wok vegetables, beef burgers, mini croissants (lazy Sunday, woohoo) and a tub of Bonne Maman milk jam ice cream. I paid just over 10 euro for the lot, which seems like a good deal.</p>
<p>I took home the Picard leaflet and discovered that there are a million more products available. I&#8217;m happy enough with the small selection in Uccle though, but those who&#8217;re after the whole range might want to check out the bigger shops. Or shop online and have their frozen goodies delivered.</p>
<p>Currently, there are six shops in Brussels:<br />
170 Avenue Georges Henri<br />
670 Chaussée de Waterloo<br />
14 Avenue Hinnisdael<br />
626 Chaussée d&#8217;Alsemberg<br />
525 Rue Léopold 1er<br />
135 Chaussée d&#8217;Ixelles</p>
<p>All shops are open on Monday from 13.00-20.00, from Tuesday until Saturday between 09.00-20.00 and on Sundays between 09.00-13.00</p>

Mirrors, arts &amp; crafts material, sunscreen, curtains, a dishwasher, &#8230; And the best news of all: everything is priced cheaper than elsewhere.<span id="more-1269"></span></p>
<p>I discovered the shop a few years ago, when wandering about Rue Vanderkindere in Uccle. It doesn&#8217;t look like much from the outside, but once inside, it&#8217;s a bit like Ali Baba&#8217;s cave. One with about five long alleys, packed to the top with shelves displaying all sorts of (non-food) items.</p>
<p>I love their arts &amp; crafts range, perfect to get creative. Their area with cooking and baking supplies is great too. I head to Stockline when I&#8217;m throwing a BBQ or picnic, as they have a wide range of disposable plates, cups and cutlery. They have an &#8216;outdoor&#8217; section too, with gardening tools, anti-mosquito sprays and all sorts of equipment to keep your pets happy.</p>
<p>Those looking for electrical appliances will find a large range at the back of the shop. I bought my Babyliss blow dryer for 30 euro, and saw similar models for over 50 euro in other shops. Great deals to be scored.</p>
<p>And finally, pop into Stockline when you&#8217;re looking for a gift, but don&#8217;t seem to have a clue what to go for. They sell nice toys, picture frames, cast iron cooking pots, scented candles, cosmetics, and more..</p>
<p>I always shop at the store down Rue Vanderkindere, but there are more Stockline shops in Brussels (see below). When in Uccle, it&#8217;s only a few minutes walk to two other great places: Italian food market <a title="Stival Mercato" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/%3Fp=253">Stival</a> and ice cream parlour <a title="Zizi" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/%3Fp=382">Zizi</a>!</p>
<p>465 Rue Vanderkindere, open from Monday until Saturday, between 10.00-19.00</p>
<p>48 Avenue Tervueren, open from Monday until Saturday, between 10.00-18.30</p>
<p>1565 Chaussée de Wavre, open from Wedneday until Saturday between 10.00-18.30, on Sundays between 11.00-17.00</p>
