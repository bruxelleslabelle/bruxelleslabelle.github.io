<p><a title="Dille &amp; Kamille" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/%3Fp=156">Dille &amp; Kamille</a>: For cute wooden and papier maché baubles (such as the ones depicted above), Christmas crackers, napkins, Christmas-themed cookie cutters, wrapping paper and tags and everything you could possibly think of to decorate your table. Not too expensive, although you want everything and end up with a full bag (it happened to me).</p>
<p><strong>Maisons du Monde</strong>: While I&#8217;m not a big fan of this furniture and deco shop throughout the year, I do love their Christmas selection. Candles, blankets with Fair Isle prints, and enough baubles and pendants to decorate an entire pine forest. From &#8216;antique&#8217; styled baubles to cookies and gingerbread men (my favourite). Lots of glitter and gold, and circus-related deco as well (even though I don&#8217;t get the link with x-mas). Reasonably priced. Anspach Shopping Centre, accessible via Boulevard Anspach.</p>
<p><strong>New Dewolf</strong>: This shops has been around for ages and is usually the first one in town with a Christmas tree in the window. They specialise in all things deco and go the extra mile in the months leading to the holiday season. You won&#8217;t find &#8216;basics&#8217;, but you can chose from a wicked series of brightly coloured, glass decoration for your tree: from cellphones to dancing squirrels. You read that right. Pricey.  91, Rue Haute</p>
<p><strong>Oxfam Fair Trade shop</strong>: I used to live near an Oxfam Fair Trade shop and loved to visit every now and then for coffee, chocolate, honey and more. They sell candles and decoration as well, made by artisans from countries such as Thailand and Madagascar. I picked up the cutest ceramics nativity scene from Bolivia. While you&#8217;re there, try the fair trade wine and bubbles, and get some of the yucca crisps or nuts to hosts your next party. The quality of the products is amazing. You might pay a bit more than elsewhere, but your money goes straight to the farmers and artisans. There are several of these shops in Brussels, the one in the centre is quite a big one. 137, Boulevard Anspach (1000 Bxl)</p>
<p><a title="Zara Home" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/%3Fp=684">Zara Home</a>: Lots of glitter and gold this season, with items to decorate your entire house (including bed and bathroom!). Every year, they have the best selection for candle lovers (scented or x-mas shaped). On Avenue Louise and at the Woluwe Shopping Centre.</p>
