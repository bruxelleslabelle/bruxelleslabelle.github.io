It might be quite a trek to get there, but the choice, great prices and super friendly owners make more than up for that.<span id="more-1634"></span></p>
<p>The shop is run by Nathalie and Lucie. While the former is a fan of all things antique, the latter prefers the 70s. They both search high and low (from antique markets to people&#8217;s basements) for the best items at the best price. As they love browsing, they have an enormous stock of furniture and deco which they&#8217;d like to rotate as quickly as possible. As a result, everything you buy at L&#8217;Atelier des Marquises comes with a very acceptable price tag.</p>
<p>I loved their range of cute coffee tables, from a yellow one from the 60s to a tiled one from the 70s. Magazine racks, vintage cups and plates, old wooden chairs and sofas, the place is packed with treasures from the past. In the future, the ladies plan courses where they&#8217;ll teach you how to freshen up old furniture. Clever idea.</p>
<p>Note: I took the picture from the shop&#8217;s Facebook page, as I simply forgot to take one while I was there. That&#8217;s how much I enjoyed the shop!</p>
<p>98 Rue Middelbourg, open from Wednesday until Saturday, between 10.30-18.30 and on Sundays between 10.30-14.30</p>

But if there was one bakery closer to home, I would like it to be (just like) Bairin in Watermael Boitsfort.<span id="more-574"></span></p>
<p>First of all, Bairin looks so pretty. Big windows, displaying all the sweet goods: Danish pastry, jams, biscuits, cakes, etc. As soon as you open the door, the smell of freshly baked bread welcomes you. The second one to do that, is the friendly lady behind the counter.</p>
<p>The place is a real village bakery, where everyone who walks in knows each other, and where the baker lady nearly always guesses axactly what her customers came for. I felt a bit left out when I was last there, I have to admit &#8230; but then again, I don&#8217;t live anywhere near Bairin.</p>
<p>I opted for a crispy croissant, and was quite tempted to get a jar of raspberry jam, some biscuits and (why not) even a tub of homemade ice cream. But as I had so much to do that day before heading home &#8230; none of the things mentioned after &#8216;croissant&#8217; left the shop with me.</p>
<p>Anyone else who thinks there should be more bakeries like that?</p>
<p>21, Place Keym, closed on Mondays</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/josy.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-559" title="josy" src="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/josy-e1317205916820-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>I rarely come to Watermael Boitsfort. To be completely honest: I&#8217;ve been there twice. But the communal heart (Place Keym) is home to such a wonderful gem, I should make an effort more often: organic grocery store and eatery Chez Josy.<span id="more-558"></span></p>
<p>The name of the place is a combination of both owners Joëlle and Sylvie. The two women opened their cosy eatery about two years ago, and have been very busy ever since.</p>
<p>First of all, Chez Josy looks so pretty. There are bright yellow seats on the terrace outside, and small tables inside. Good to know: the decoration is for sale. Tea boxes by Kusmi, pink and baby blue English tea cups, plates etc on the one side, organic groceries (fruit &amp; veg, dairy products, condiments, ..) on the other.</p>
<p>Chez Josy opens in the morning, and serves great coffee, cakes and yoghurt for breakfast. Around lunch time, you&#8217;re welcome for a bowl of soup or a hot dish. In the afternoon: cake again!</p>
<p>Rumour has it that soon some extra space will be added, allowing the grocery shop and the eatery to have their own separated space. An extra reason to head to Watermael in the near future.</p>
<p>15 Place Keym, open from Monday to Saturday, from 10.30-18.00</p>
