The Black Sheep behind Place Flagey has got both, and serves a mean burger to boot.<span id="more-2014"></span></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve visited The Black Sheep a couple of times now, and I felt a post was needed as the place got better every time.</p>
<p>On my first visit, my friends and I were after some comfort food and drinks on a rainy Sunday afternoon. We picked The Black Sheep, but had no idea what to expect. It&#8217;s definitely not your average English/Irish pub with wood cladded walls, carpet floors, Guinness memorabilia and &#8216;The Wild Rover&#8217; songs. The place is quite large actually, with seating available for just over 100 people at the same time. There&#8217;s a very large bar with well stocked fridges ( a varied choice of Belgian craft beers, the Brewdog UK range and much more). And, you can pay by card (hurray for that!)</p>
<p>First time there, we went for Fish &amp; Chips and a cocktail (or a fancy beer for the men). It did the trick. The place wasn&#8217;t very busy, but the staff were great, the cocktails were spot-on and the bill not too expensive.</p>
<p>One of the next visits was a Friday night. A completely different scene, with people dancing and very busy bar tenders. One of them suggested making me a &#8216;Tiramisu Martini&#8217;, which basically is a liquid dessert with cold coffee, cream and a fair bit of alcohol. Bonkers, but so good.</p>
<p>Our last visit definitely was the best one. Lured in by a new menu featuring burgers, chicken and fish and chips, my friends and I planned another trip on a Sunday evening. The ladies ordered cocktails (try the Bramble with gin and berry liqueur, 7,5 euro), the boys went for beers (try the Paix Dieu beer (10%), only brewed when there&#8217;s a full moon) and we ordered a platter of starters as well. Served on a wooden board, we got tempura vegetables with homemade dips, nacho crackers with cheese and mozzarella bread. The Black Sheep has a new chef who loves to make everything himself, which is great (and absolutely an upgrade from the usual pub grub).</p>
<p>We all ordered burgers (priced around 12 euro). The new menu has amongst others a classic version, the Ring of Fire (with chorizo) and the Jack Daniels (with whiskey marinated beef and bacon). Choosing is losing, and we all ended up with a different one. The buns (classic or rustic) were made with the chef&#8217;s own recipe and so was the meat. And the chips deserve a few lines of attention as well: they&#8217;re something in between potato wedges and french fries, deep fried in beef fat. Best (pub) fries ever!</p>
<p>To round up our greasy (but tasty!) Sunday, we got dessert as well. Vanilla ice cream fried in an oreo biscuit crust, a Ferrero Rocher mini muffin and a shot of Tiramisu Martini (hello again!). A bit much, but if you&#8217;re testing a new menu, you might as well do it right …. and we&#8217;ll definitely do it again.</p>
<p>Extra credits go to manager Chris and his team for making us feel very welcome and helping us pick the right food and drinks, the chef for choosing to make everything himself, and the playlist of the evening featuring a lot of Oasis.</p>
<p>Note: I snapped some pictures, but the evening light really didn&#8217;t do the food any justice.</p>
<p>Note2: Check The Black Sheep&#8217;s Facebook page for updates on parties, comedy nights, the new menu and much more.</p>
<p>8, Chaussée de Boondael, open Wed-Thu 17.00-01.00, Fri-Sat 17.00-03.00 and Sun 17.00-00.00</p>

With good reason: Japanese ramen bar Kokuban is every bit as good as you&#8217;d expect. <span id="more-1981"></span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s always bustling at Kokuban, and it&#8217;s best to book a table. The menu mainly features delicious noodle dishes, served in a pretty white and blue bowl. There are some salads as well. But while waiting for your main dish, I suggest you spark your appetite with some gyoza. Filled with chicken and vegetables, these Japanese ravioli go down a treat. Or go for some crunchy Edamame (green beans).</p>
<p>The ramen are freshly made at Kokuban, and come served in a super tasty broth. I choose the Karaage ramen: crispy chicken, soy beans in a chicken and vegetable bouillon. Just perfect.</p>
<p>Go authentic and have some plum wine or (hot) saké with it .. or don&#8217;t, and have a glass of white wine (which I did).</p>
<p>If you fancy dessert afterwards, they serve amongst others Japanese flavoured ice cream (with green tea, black and white sesame) and almond pudding.</p>
<p>Eating at Kokuban is always a good idea, whether there&#8217;s just two of you or you&#8217;re dining with a larger group. And more good news: main courses are priced between 12 and 18 euro!</p>
<p>Note: The food was so nice I forgot to snap a picture. The one in this post is from the Kokuban website.</p>
<p>53-55, Rue Vilain XIIII, Ixelles, open every day but Sunday between 12.00-14.00 and 19.00-22.00</p>

Boring, but it does the trick. On my (rare) days off, I&#8217;d love to discover something new. And the rice paper rolls at Knees to Chin were the perfect change from my routine.<span id="more-1975"></span></p>
<p>The small eatery in the Bailli-Chatelain area opened recently and is entirely dedicated to Vietnamese rice paper rolls. They come with a couple of different fillings, sauces and side dishes.</p>
<p>The day I sat down for lunch, I could choose between pork, scampi, duck or chicken. All rolls were priced at 3,80 euro. As it was lunch time, you could opt for the 8 euro meal deal, which includes two rolls and a bowl of rice or cabbage salad. I didn&#8217;t go for it though, and picked two rolls: one with chicken, one with scampi.</p>
<p>My friend and I sat outside -inside was packed, always a good sign- and were served a couple minutes after ordering. We got an explanation of what sauce to have with each of the rolls and tucked in.</p>
<p>The rolls were quite large and generously filled. The chicken one came with crunchy leaves, noodles, fried onions and a peanut sauce. The scampi one also had mint an mango wrapped in it, and came with a light avocado sauce. Both were delicious. Light, but filling. My friend said the same was true for the duck one.</p>
<p>We couldn&#8217;t stay for dessert and coffee unfortunately. But do try the cake when you&#8217;re there, it looked delicious!</p>
<p>Note: everything is available for take-out too.</p>
<p>125 Rue de Livourne, Ixelles, Monday until Friday between 11.30-21.30, Wednesday 11.30-15.00 and Saturday 12.00-18.00</p>

Some of them are ugly, some delicate, some kitsch … If you&#8217;ve had enough of that, Le Typographe sells a great alternative: quality paper ones with a simple print, handmade in Brussels.<span id="more-1926"></span></p>
<p>The shop and &#8216;factory&#8217; are located in a big mansion in Ixelles. There&#8217;s classical music playing in the background, and paper and stationary items on shelves and tables.</p>
<p>During the holidays, the greeting cards are the most popular. Printed with an old Heidelberg letter press, they come in a couple of sizes and colours. If you&#8217;re going for something unique, you can make your own by choosing paper, envelopes and draw or write your own design (the choice is overwhelming), or go for a special print and ask the staff at Le Typographe for help.</p>
<p>The shop is perfect for last-minute gift picking as well. From notebooks, to do-lists and calendars (all made in-house) to fancy writing pens and pouches to store your pencils.</p>
<p>And while it might be too late to buy this year&#8217;s Christmas cards and have them sent on time, think about Le Typographe for next year (or any upcoming birthday). You can&#8217;t go wrong with <em>made in Brussels.</em></p>
<p>67 Rue Américaine, open from Monday until Friday between 13.00-18.00, Saturday from 11.30-18.00</p>

<p>Shop owner Pascaline loves all things graphic. She creates her own prints too, and has them printed on t-shirts and sweaters, available for men, women and kids.</p>
<p>Besides clothing, there&#8217;s a lot more to discover. Some of my favourite items were the coffee cups with black and white design, the diamond shaped china boxes, the metal baskets and the wooden cabin. The last one was designed for children, but is available for grown-ups too.</p>
<p>As of January 2014, Pacaline will organise creative workshops too. On Sunday afternoons, children can learn how to make their own graphic design and have it printed on a t-shirt. Adults in need of design inspiration can ask Pascaline for help too, from the creation of your business cards to the invitation to your next party.</p>
<p>Cool shop!</p>

<p>Gazzetta is the little brother of Al Dente, an Italian restaurant in Uccle. It opened a few weeks ago and I was happy to check it out recently.</p>
<p>The decor (as you can see on the picture) is great. The glass structure holds some Italian delights such as panettone, grisini breadsticks, and pesto sauces. Above and around the bar counter, more pretty cardboard boxes with panettone, pasta and jars with savoury food.</p>
<p>There aren&#8217;t many seats available and making reservations isn&#8217;t possible. It tends to get quite busy after work, but I popped in around 5.00 in the afternoon and had no trouble finding a seat and ordering a creamy cappuccino.</p>
<p>After-work drinks come with small bites of ham and cheese, and if your belly is rumbling, there&#8217;s one dish served every day as well: simple, but very tasty Italian meals. I&#8217;ll have to try that soon!</p>
<p>Note: they do weekend brunch too!</p>
<p>12 Rue de la Longue Haie, open every day from 09.00-23.00</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll find L&#8217;Amour Fou near Place Fernand Cocq. It&#8217;s quite a large eatery, with burgers and salads on the menu. The bread buns are homemade, how nice is that? There&#8217;s an impressive cocktail and rum list too. Great spot for food AND drinks.</p>
<p>Their menu features banoffee pie as well, which we had to try of course. L&#8217;Amour Fou claims to be the only one serving it in Brussels, but I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ve seen it on the menu at <a title="Merrily’s" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/p=1">Merrily&#8217;s</a> too. (It was tasty, but served with too much whipped cream, also very, very sweet).</p>

It&#8217;s connected to second-hand book shop Pêle-Mêle on Chaussée de Waterloo as well. Books and healthy food, what&#8217;s not to like?<span id="more-1867"></span></p>
<p>First of all: the place looks great. There are a couple of long tables, cozy corners with vintage-looking sofas, there&#8217;s a cute caravan as well, just sit where you like.</p>
<p>Secondly: to make things easier for the chef and the customers, there are only two lunch options. A small one at 15 euro with a starter and a main meal, or a bigger one at 18 euro consisting of a soup, a started, a main meal and dessert. There are several sweet options to go with afternoon coffee or tea, and on Friday evening you can choose tapas as well. Weekend is all about brunch and lunch.</p>
<p>When my friend and I arrived at Garage à Manger, it was just after one o&#8217;clock and the place was very busy. We managed to get a spot on the sofa, from where we could watch the crowd and spot two empty seats. It took a while before they became available, but we ended up at one of the long tables. We both chose the small option, which that day consisted of prawn clafouti and veal osso buco. I&#8217;ve never had savoury clafouti before, but it tasted really good. Served with rustic bread and a side salad, things looked very promising.</p>
<p>Waiting for the main course took a lot longer than expected. By the time it arrived at our table, almost an hour had gone past and we were nearly the only ones left in the eatery. The girl apologised and explained they ran out of osso buco so the chef had to come up with something else. Instead, we got served veal in a tomato-y sauce with melted scamorza cheese and grilled vegetables (parsnips, onions and garlic). A nice dish, but as my friend noticed, they could have checked with us first. (luckily none of us has a dairy allergy).</p>
<p>There was no time left to order coffee unfortunately.</p>
<p>Great concept, tasty food &#8230; maybe hopefully a quicker service next time (lunch breaks on weekdays are 60 minutes only &#8230;)</p>
<p>185 Rue Washington, open Monday until Sunday between 10.00-18.30, Friday until 21.00</p>

But I love to spend time in the kitchen, browse the web and books for recipes and visit shops for unusual ingredients. Kis Mad was on my radar for a while, and now I finally visited the shop.<span id="more-1862"></span></p>
<p>The epicerie fine has two shops, one in Saint-Gilles and one in Ixelles. I went to the latter.</p>
<p>The shop was smaller than I expected, with the most luscious-looking fruit and vegetables at the front, and condiments and spices at the back. What a difference from your average supermarket where everything is packed, wrapped and piled up. The raspberries where the biggest I&#8217;d ever seen, the mushrooms the healthiest, the tomatoes the happiest (yes, happy!).</p>
<p>As I was feeling a bit under the weather, the main goal of my visit was to find a treat to make me feel better. Nougat or boiled sweeties? Or Italian crackers flavoured with fennel or chilli seeds? Or spreadable chocolate orange? I couldn&#8217;t choose and the rack with spices distracted me as well. I&#8217;m a big fan of pepper, and the variety of pepper corns made me dream of sunny and far-away countries.</p>
<p>Back to the treats &#8230; I ended up brining &#8216;milk jam&#8217; and white Earl Grey tea to the till. I can&#8217;t wait to taste the jam (which will be sweet and sticky, like dulce de leche) and as for the tea &#8230; it was just what I needed, a hot drink with lovely bergamot flavours (that went nicely with writing this post).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure the shop will get another visit soon, when I&#8217;ll be looking for Christmas inspiration!</p>
<p>504 Chaussée de Waterloo, open every day but Wednesday, between 10.00-19.30, Sundays between 10.00-17.00<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/pika-pika.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1857" alt="pika pika" src="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/pika-pika-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a>How could I resist this colourful window display? It belongs to Pika Pika Japan, a new shop selling toys, items and clothes all the way from Japan. <span id="more-1856"></span></p>
<p>A while ago, there was a similar shop with the same name (and by the same owner) down Rue Lombard in the city centre. I never walked in the shop, but the day I was planning to do so, it was shut. When walking on Chaussée de Waterloo one day, (on my way to <a title="Bang Bang" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/p=665">Bang Bang</a>, to be precise), I noticed this new shop and walked in right away.</p>
<p>Lots of colours, lots of shapes, lots of cute little toys staring at you with big eyes. Inflatable animals, notebooks, mobile phone pendants, socks, piggy banks, stickers, markers &#8230; an incredible selection of Japanese stuff. If you&#8217;re not sure what you&#8217;re looking at, the owner and the shop assistant have tons of stories to tell.</p>
<p>I loved the little green and orange bird that tweeted every now and again, when  somebody walks passed it. But eventually left the shop with a bright red Kewpie, a plastic adorable little figurine, with wings and big eyes. It doesn&#8217;t do anything, but when I look at it, I cannot but smile.</p>
<p>Note: Everything is directly imported from Japan, which explains the price. Nothing it too expensive, though.</p>
<p>525 a, Chaussée de Waterloo, open every day but Sunday, between 11.00-19.00</p>
