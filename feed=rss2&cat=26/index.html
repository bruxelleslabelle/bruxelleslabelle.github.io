Mirrors, arts &amp; crafts material, sunscreen, curtains, a dishwasher, &#8230; And the best news of all: everything is priced cheaper than elsewhere.<span id="more-1269"></span></p>
<p>I discovered the shop a few years ago, when wandering about Rue Vanderkindere in Uccle. It doesn&#8217;t look like much from the outside, but once inside, it&#8217;s a bit like Ali Baba&#8217;s cave. One with about five long alleys, packed to the top with shelves displaying all sorts of (non-food) items.</p>
<p>I love their arts &amp; crafts range, perfect to get creative. Their area with cooking and baking supplies is great too. I head to Stockline when I&#8217;m throwing a BBQ or picnic, as they have a wide range of disposable plates, cups and cutlery. They have an &#8216;outdoor&#8217; section too, with gardening tools, anti-mosquito sprays and all sorts of equipment to keep your pets happy.</p>
<p>Those looking for electrical appliances will find a large range at the back of the shop. I bought my Babyliss blow dryer for 30 euro, and saw similar models for over 50 euro in other shops. Great deals to be scored.</p>
<p>And finally, pop into Stockline when you&#8217;re looking for a gift, but don&#8217;t seem to have a clue what to go for. They sell nice toys, picture frames, cast iron cooking pots, scented candles, cosmetics, and more..</p>
<p>I always shop at the store down Rue Vanderkindere, but there are more Stockline shops in Brussels (see below). When in Uccle, it&#8217;s only a few minutes walk to two other great places: Italian food market <a title="Stival Mercato" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/p=253">Stival</a> and ice cream parlour <a title="Zizi" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/p=382">Zizi</a>!</p>
<p>465 Rue Vanderkindere, open from Monday until Saturday, between 10.00-19.00</p>
<p>48 Avenue Tervueren, open from Monday until Saturday, between 10.00-18.30</p>
<p>1565 Chaussée de Wavre, open from Wedneday until Saturday between 10.00-18.30, on Sundays between 11.00-17.00</p>

What started about twenty years ago with a small bread shop in Rue Dansaert, grew into an international chain business with shops all over Europe, the United States and Australia.<span id="more-933"></span></p>
<p>Le Pain Quotidien&#8217;s core business is bread: big round breads that take up to 8 hours to make and bake. Gradually the shop added all sorts of sweet breakfast rolls to its assortment, as well as jams and chocolate spreads (most of them made from organic produce).</p>
<p>Big wooden tables that seat up to 10 people, artisanal bread and great coffee. See how this concept had everything it needed to become a success?</p>
<p>Over the years, lots of things were added to the menu. LPQ (as it&#8217;s often called in other countries, because the pronunciation isn&#8217;t easy) also has sandwiches for lunch, and sells all sorts of olive oils, sweeties, cordials etc for you to create a yummy breakfast/lunch at home.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to pick my favourite item of the menu. For some reason, LPQ is the only place where I order a cappuccino instead of a regular coffee. Don&#8217;t ask why, because I really don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>9 locations in Brussels, open every day</p>

<p>The big blackboard outside lists the available flavours: sausages with herbs, curry, cheese, Chimay beer etc.  If you can&#8217;t choose, the butcher sells a mix of sausages on a skewer as well. They all come at the same price, i.e. 21 euro per kilo (and there are many many sausages in one kilo).</p>
<p>The butcher is famous for all things bbq, including marinated meat and a delicious grilled vegetable salad. If you are in the area, or have time to spare before a garden party &#8230; this is the place to turn to!</p>
<p>67 Rue des Tongres, open every day but Sunday, between 09.00-18.00</p>
