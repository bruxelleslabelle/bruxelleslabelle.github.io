Sweet, creamy, crusty … it put a big smile on my face! This delicious custard tart is available from the Portuguese bakery on Chaussée de Charleroi.<span id="more-1937"></span></p>
<p>For years in a row, Forcado (then called &#8216;Le Petit Forcado&#8217;) was nothing more but a tiny shop with a hidden kitchen, where the Portuguese baker would spend most of his day making several batches of the pastels. There was no space to sit down and enjoy the treats with coffee. But when you visited the bakery, the owner would happily step out of his kitchen and explain all about his little tarts.</p>
<p>Last summer, Forcado expanded to a larger space a couple houses further up Chaussée de Charleroi (across from <a title="King Kong" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/p=1962">King Kong</a>), run by the son of the Portuguese baker. There&#8217;s a big counter with a varied choice in patels (classic one, with speculoos, with coffee, with fresh raspberries or lemon). There are gluten free little cakes too, flavoured with chocolate and orange. All made at the old Forcado, and brought to the shop by the dad (on his slippers!)</p>
<p>They go really well with a nice cup of coffee and are dangerously more-ish!</p>
<p>Treats come at +/- 1,7 euro each, and are worth every cent.</p>
<p>-&gt; More Portuguese food? Try the cozy tea-room<a title="Jynga" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/p=1536"> Jynga</a> or shop wines and condiments at <a title="The Sol Ar Store" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/p=1038">Sol Ar</a>.</p>
<p>196-198, Chaussée de Charleroi, open from Tuesday until Sunday, between 10.00-18.00</p>

I thought it would be a tourist-y place, but it&#8217;s nothing like that (forgive me dear reader, I get it wrong sometimes).<span id="more-1998"></span></p>
<p>In fact, Ponti Corner is quite a large, and very pretty coffee bar/eatery with an outside terrace looking out to the Bourse building. Once inside, there&#8217;s a very large counter with fresh pastry and shelves packed with biscuits, jams and other treats, as well as ample seats and tables. At the back of Ponti, there are chesterfield sofas and more tables. There are magazines everywhere, books on interior design, chandeliers made with coffee cups and a great picture of Jack Nicholson.</p>
<p>The place looks great, and so does the menu. There&#8217;s breakfast (served until 11.30h), sandwich lunch, hot meals, dessert and treats and cocktails. Lots to choose from, but as it was (late) lunch time when we arrived, we sat down in one of the chesterfields and I ordered a toasted sandwich with ham on the bone and mature cheese. My friend went for the smoked salmon sandwich (both were beautifully presented and priced around 8 euro, which I must admit was a bit on the high side).</p>
<p>We had to wait quite a while before our lunch arrived (it wasn&#8217;t so bad in our case, as we had lots to chat about &#8211; but our neighbours at the table seemed to be less enthusiastic about having to wait that long). Once the food arrived, we tucked in right away. You can&#8217;t go wrong with a cheese toastie, and served with a tasty salad, it made for a nice lunch.</p>
<p>We didn&#8217;t stay for coffee, but the baked treats in the counter looked very tempting. We queued to pay and overheard the people in front of us complain about having to wait too long for their food as well. Growing pains, I hope, as Ponti Corner is a great addition to the city centre, whether you&#8217;re after breakfast, lunch, an afternoon break, afterwork drinks or pre-party cocktails!</p>
<p>41, Rue Henri Maus, open every day between 08.00-22.00</p>

It&#8217;s a cozy eatery with vegan, vegetarian and gluten free food, both sweet and savoury.<span id="more-1992"></span></p>
<p>I first visited Mémé Café a while ago. It was late afternoon, I was hungry and stumbled upon the place by accident. The sandwich I ordered was no longer available, but the owner suggested a great-sounding mix of whatever was left. While waiting for my sandwich to get toasted, I overheard him explaining all about his tea selection to a couple of ladies. Such passion and enthusiasm, it was lovely to see.</p>
<p>I paid for my sandwich, left and couldn&#8217;t wait to taste. The toasted bread was filled with caramelised onions, semi-dried tomatoes and roquette salad, a sweet, crunchy and salty mix that left my tastebuds happy for the rest of the day. (And made me regret not having ordered one of his banana and raspberry muffins).</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, a friend ordered her birthday cake at Mémé Café. Luck was on my side, it was a large banana, raspberry and chocolate cake! No gluten, no extra sugar, but deliciously moist and rich in flavour. Almost too good to be true.</p>
<p>When I was in the area again last week, I went back for a sandwich (and finally, a picture). It was lunch time, but not too busy (probably because it&#8217;s a bit off the beaten lunch track). I went for a feta cheese and tomato sandwich. The owner -still as enthusiastic as the first time- suggested adding some crunchy cabbage to it, which was a great idea (again).</p>
<p>I usually have my lunch on the go, but if you have time, I suggest you sit down for breakfast, brunch or lunch and take the time to enjoy all the homemade food. Besides sandwiches and sweet cakes or muffins, there are salads and quiches too.</p>
<p>Hmm, I&#8217;d love a banana muffin and a cup of coffee right now!</p>
<p>Note: Thanks Jyl and Michelle for suggesting a post on Mémé Cafe, happy to read you love this place too!</p>
<p>17 Rue des Riches Claires, open from Tue-Fri between 08.45-18.30 and on Sat from 10.00-19.00</p>

This new-ish coffee bar deserves all the attention, as the brews (and the cakes) are delicious.<span id="more-1986"></span></p>
<p>You&#8217;ll find Bocca Moka on Chaussée de Charleroi, near great Thai place <a title="Premier Comptoir Thai" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/p=144">Premier Comptoir Thai</a>. You can&#8217;t miss the place, there&#8217;s usually a black board with funny quotes outside. It&#8217;s a spacious coffee bar with ample seating near the window, at the back, on the lower floor and in the garden (yes, there&#8217;s a terrace too).</p>
<p>While you can order a simple cappuccino or an espresso, I recommend you take the time to read the coffee menu and pick something new. A Japanese syphon coffee for instance, where a halogen lamp slowly heats the water and a perfect cup of coffee is prepared drip by drip. These so-called slow coffees are &#8216;a thing&#8217; nearly every where else in Europe, but luckily there are coffee bars in Brussels joining the movement as well. Slow drip coffees are very light in taste, but so full of flavour. It&#8217;s a new way of drinking of coffee, which requires utmost precision and timing while making it (you&#8217;ll see the barista weighing the ground coffee!), but it&#8217;s worth the wait.</p>
<p>Next on my &#8216;to-try list&#8217; : a barraquito, a coffee with condensed milk, foamed milk and cinnamon. Oh that, and a slice of apple pie!</p>
<p>Bocca Moka does great take-out coffee too, and has bagels for lunch.</p>
<p>41 Chaussée de Charleroi, open every day but Sunday from 07.30-18.00 (on Sat, as of 08.00)</p>

Boring, but it does the trick. On my (rare) days off, I&#8217;d love to discover something new. And the rice paper rolls at Knees to Chin were the perfect change from my routine.<span id="more-1975"></span></p>
<p>The small eatery in the Bailli-Chatelain area opened recently and is entirely dedicated to Vietnamese rice paper rolls. They come with a couple of different fillings, sauces and side dishes.</p>
<p>The day I sat down for lunch, I could choose between pork, scampi, duck or chicken. All rolls were priced at 3,80 euro. As it was lunch time, you could opt for the 8 euro meal deal, which includes two rolls and a bowl of rice or cabbage salad. I didn&#8217;t go for it though, and picked two rolls: one with chicken, one with scampi.</p>
<p>My friend and I sat outside -inside was packed, always a good sign- and were served a couple minutes after ordering. We got an explanation of what sauce to have with each of the rolls and tucked in.</p>
<p>The rolls were quite large and generously filled. The chicken one came with crunchy leaves, noodles, fried onions and a peanut sauce. The scampi one also had mint an mango wrapped in it, and came with a light avocado sauce. Both were delicious. Light, but filling. My friend said the same was true for the duck one.</p>
<p>We couldn&#8217;t stay for dessert and coffee unfortunately. But do try the cake when you&#8217;re there, it looked delicious!</p>
<p>Note: everything is available for take-out too.</p>
<p>125 Rue de Livourne, Ixelles, Monday until Friday between 11.30-21.30, Wednesday 11.30-15.00 and Saturday 12.00-18.00</p>

I had heard and read great things about the place, so I walked in with high expectations. I liked it, but didn&#8217;t leave raving about it, as others seemed to do.<span id="more-1967"></span></p>
<p>You&#8217;ll find the eatery down Rue Marché aux Poulets, a couple of houses away from coffee roasters <a title="Corica" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/p=109">Corica</a> and fish &amp; chips joint <a title="Bia Mara" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/p=1343">Bia Mara</a> (whose owners helped set up Peck 47). There&#8217;s a big black board with quotes and parts of the menu outside, as well as some tables and seats (unfortunately, the street isn&#8217;t the most cozy of the centre).</p>
<p>Inside, I loved the decor. Sit down at the table or the comfy sofa, a friendly member of staff will bring the menu. Around lunch time, there are mainly salads (around 8 euro) or sandwiches to choose from. I ordered The Pecker (chicken sandwich), my friend The Italian (with salami). While waiting for our order, we picked a drink from the counter. That left us a little disappointed,  as it stocked nothing we hadn&#8217;t seen before (San Pellegrini lemonades, Tao drinks, Bolbu chocolate milk, …) We probably should have gone for a pitcher of Pimm&#8217;s, but work had to be done in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Our sandwiches came after a few minutes, served on a wooden board with a small soup. That was a nice surprise, it tasted great. The sandwich itself was ok, but white baguettes …. I don&#8217;t know. I think it would have tasted better with darker bread.</p>
<p>We left, paying 7,5 euro for a lunch (sandwich and a tao) that kept us full all afternoon. Full, but not raving. Maybe we should go back and try their breakfast or brunch? Anyhow, Peck 47 is now on my &#8216;to visit again&#8217; list.</p>
<p>47, Rue Marché aux Poulets, open every day from 08.30-20.00 (weekends open as of 11.00)</p>

It has lost some popularity over the years (to the bigger baguette), but there&#8217;s a new eatery at Sablon, keen to restore the pistolet in all its glory.<span id="more-1922"></span></p>
<p>Pistolet Original sells crunchy buns filled with all the Belgian classics: <em>américain</em> with cress, meat balls with piccalilli, prawns from the North Sea or raw ham from the Ardennes.</p>
<p>There are a couple of tables, so you can eat inside (and enjoy a sweet dessert &#8211; again, classics such as frangipane or boule de berlin- with coffee), or take out. There are some shelves with deli foods too, sweets, beer, juices and the like, all Belgian stuff too.</p>
<p>I popped in around lunch time and queued a few minutes before I ordered my pistolet américain. It was wrapped in a paper bag with the shop&#8217;s logo and set me back 3,5 euro. Pricy, I know, but it tasted great (although I should have ordered two).</p>
<p>Great concept. And judging by the number of visitors (and Facebook likes), I&#8217;m definitely not the only one with this opinion.</p>
<p>24 Rue Joseph Stevens, open every day between 08.00-18.00 (&gt; 23.00 on Thursdays)</p>

<p>It&#8217;s good to see new eateries and shops pop up. Times are still tough, but who dares wins. The owners of John &amp; Rose came up with such a clever concept, and indeed … it works!</p>
<p>The menu features food and snacks to still your cravings at any moment of the day. Breakfast with homemade jam in the morning, soup or thick slices of bread with generous toppings and cake and desserts for after. The coffee tastes good too (I checked, of course).</p>
<p>Every now and then they change the art works on the wall. You can rent the place for private venues (it&#8217;s large!) and the large piano near the bar suggests John &amp; Rose would make an excellent concert venue too.</p>
<p>Well done!</p>
<p>80-84 Rue de Flandre, open from Tuesday until Sunday between 11.00-18.00</p>

<p>Gazzetta is the little brother of Al Dente, an Italian restaurant in Uccle. It opened a few weeks ago and I was happy to check it out recently.</p>
<p>The decor (as you can see on the picture) is great. The glass structure holds some Italian delights such as panettone, grisini breadsticks, and pesto sauces. Above and around the bar counter, more pretty cardboard boxes with panettone, pasta and jars with savoury food.</p>
<p>There aren&#8217;t many seats available and making reservations isn&#8217;t possible. It tends to get quite busy after work, but I popped in around 5.00 in the afternoon and had no trouble finding a seat and ordering a creamy cappuccino.</p>
<p>After-work drinks come with small bites of ham and cheese, and if your belly is rumbling, there&#8217;s one dish served every day as well: simple, but very tasty Italian meals. I&#8217;ll have to try that soon!</p>
<p>Note: they do weekend brunch too!</p>
<p>12 Rue de la Longue Haie, open every day from 09.00-23.00</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Lavazza.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1880" alt="Lavazza" src="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Lavazza-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a>Italian coffee maker Lavazza opened its first boutique in Brussels. I had to check it out of course. <span id="more-1879"></span></p>
<p>You&#8217;ll find the boutique down Boulevard Jacqmain, on the edge of the city centre in an area packed with office buildings. But there&#8217;s a reason for it. It&#8217;s a shop, not a café: the place you come to for advice and purchase coffee <em>en masse</em>, rather than walk out with a coffee to go.</p>
<p>On my way there, I was quite excited to discover new blends and see Lavazza memorabilia. Unfortunately that wasn&#8217;t the case. Lavazza Italy picked a couple of coffees for the Belgian market to play it safe (blame the crisis, I guess). A bit of a missed opportunity I feel, although the shop owner told me they would review the range based on customer&#8217;s feedback. As I&#8217;m spoiled for Lavazza choice at my local supermarket, I didn&#8217;t spot any new flavours. However, I was pleased to see some limited edition coffee tins, by the hand of Italian designers such as Cavalli and Moschino. Same goes for the limited edition cups and saucers, as well as the thermo-cups for the road.</p>
<p>What makes this boutique special though, is that you can follow workshops and learn how to make the perfect cup of coffee. It&#8217;s quite a skill and an award-winning barista took up the challenge to teach us how it&#8217;s done.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a new coffee maker, there are quite a few models available too.</p>
<p>128 Boulevard de Jacqmain, open from Tuesday until Saturday, between 10.00-18.00</p>
