				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/yawn.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2030" src="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/yawn-150x150.jpg" alt="yawn" width="150" height="150" /></a></strong>There&#8217;s a new concept store in town. One with a very particular concept: fashion, accessories and items from Russia, Georgia and the Ukraine.</p>
<p><span id="more-2033"></span></p>
<p>I had no idea what to expect when visiting the shop. Luckily, owners Eugene and Vladimir were more than happy to guide me through all things on display. As it turns out, designers from the former Soviet Union burst with creativity and it&#8217;s no surprise some of them got picked up by fashion magazines such as Vogue. Russian Anton Belinskiy for instance, whose collection is sold at Yawn &#8211; he even made a specially designed series of t-shirts and sweatshirts with a big print of hands spelling Y A W N in sign language.</p>
<p>Spread over two (small) floors, you&#8217;ll find clothes and accessories in bright colours. I really liked the graphic necklaces by Dis/Order (the picture above is from their collection). The leather backpacks by Pleathure are pretty cool too, with their hidden zips they&#8217;re perfect for your daily commutes (if you too had your wallet or phone stolen on a busy tram or bus, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll agree).</p>
<p>The Yawn team (or family as they call themselves) are planning quite a few cool things for Christmas, which is abundantly celebrated in Russia. Be sure to pay them a visit when you&#8217;re next in the area!</p>
<p>65, Rue du Vieux Marché aux Grains, open Mon &#8211; Wed 12.00-20.00 and Thu &#8211; Sat 12.00-22.00</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/too-many-vintage.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2007" src="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/too-many-vintage-150x150.jpg" alt="too many vintage" width="150" height="150" /></a>There aren&#8217;t many vintage shops on this blog, I know. That&#8217;s because I&#8217;m not the most eager thrift shopper in town. But the selection at the newly opened Too Many Vintage could convert me: oversized woollen coats, large cardigans and leather skirts … yes!<span id="more-2006"></span></p>
<p>You&#8217;ll find the shop on Rue des Chartreux, on the spot where <a title="Origami" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/%3Fp=1944">Origami</a> used to be. You can&#8217;t miss it, it&#8217;s the shop with the big yellow neon lights. Too Many Vintage is run by Audrey, a vintage lover from France who discovered Brussels during events such as the Vintage Market. The name of the shop is a wink at the Belgian electronic music band Too Many DJs and the fact that Brussels already has quite a few vintage shops.</p>
<p>But I feel there&#8217;s something different about this latest addition. Audrey bases her selection on what&#8217;s happening in fashion at the moment, and seeks high and low for similar pieces from a couple of decades ago. That&#8217;s probably why stepping into Too Many Vintage doesn&#8217;t feel like a trip down memory lane, more like walking into a contemporary boutique.</p>
<p>I love the selection of winter coats, from classic long ones with a fur coat, to large oversized ones, leather perfectos and entire (fake) fur ones. They&#8217;re very reasonably priced, starting at 60 going up to 200. The big cardigans are a hit too, from plain coloured ones to multi-colour models, with or without appliqué patterns. Same goes for the flannel checked shirts (for men as well), as the suede jackets and leather skirts.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a selection of bags, shoes, scarves, gloves and other accessories as well.</p>
<p>While you&#8217;re there, pop in to <a title="Brocéliande" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/%3Fp=1277">Brocéliande</a> for great vintage furniture and home interior inspiration, or go for great pizza at <a title="Divino" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/%3Fp=721">Divino</a>.</p>
<p>33-35 Rue des Chartreux, open from Tuesday until Saturday, from 11.00-18.00 ( 19.00 on Friday and Saturday)</p>

<p><a title="Divino" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/%3Fp=721"><span id="more-1944"></span></a></p>
<p>You have to enter the building first, to find the entrance door to Origami (located on your left side). Once inside, the shop is small but has plenty of things to drag your attention: there&#8217;s music, scented candles, clothes, small bits of furniture, books and stimulating energy drinks. A bit of an odd mix, but all items fit into the owner&#8217;s vision of &#8216;the human senses&#8217;. There are clothes for the tactile sense, energy drinks for your mind, books for your eyes, music for your ears, see? A concept store with a lot of concept.</p>
<p>The range of clothes wasn&#8217;t very large, with a couple of brands such as the Peruvian Misericordia, the French Kulte and the Danish Suit, a mix for men and women.</p>
<p>When I visited the shop a couple of weeks ago, it just opened. I&#8217;m quite curious to see what she&#8217;s got in store for next season.</p>
<p>33-35 Rue des Chartreux, open from Tuesday until Saturday, between 11.00-19.00</p>

<p>Shop owner Pascaline loves all things graphic. She creates her own prints too, and has them printed on t-shirts and sweaters, available for men, women and kids.</p>
<p>Besides clothing, there&#8217;s a lot more to discover. Some of my favourite items were the coffee cups with black and white design, the diamond shaped china boxes, the metal baskets and the wooden cabin. The last one was designed for children, but is available for grown-ups too.</p>
<p>As of January 2014, Pacaline will organise creative workshops too. On Sunday afternoons, children can learn how to make their own graphic design and have it printed on a t-shirt. Adults in need of design inspiration can ask Pascaline for help too, from the creation of your business cards to the invitation to your next party.</p>
<p>Cool shop!</p>
<p>72 Rue du Page, open from Wednesday until Saturday between 11.30-18.30</p>

It specialises in ethical street wear: comfy clothing, mainly made in Europe.<span id="more-1891"></span></p>
<p>The days you could only wear sweaters and sweatpants at home or at the gym are over. Today anything goes and sweaters have become a staple fashion item for even the highest of fashion brands. Yes Givenchy, I&#8217;m talking about you and your Bambi-sweater, sold(out) at 850 euro.</p>
<p>Anyway. You won&#8217;t find any of these at Voxpop. Instead, you&#8217;ll discover new, mostly German brands of clothing for men and women. Big jumpers, warm coats, jeans, t-shirts, sweaters and sweatpants, with an affordable price tag.</p>
<p>Owners Emma and Olivier met in Bolivia and settled down in Brussels (after having lived in Australia and London). They wanted to bring some of Berlin&#8217;s cool clothing vibe to Brussels and opened their shop a couple of weeks ago, along with Lennon, the coolest golden labrador you&#8217;ll probably ever meet.</p>
<p>Thumbs up for the lovely jumpers by ZB Berlin (I couldn&#8217;t resist and bought a light grey one in heavy wool, with a built-in scarf and hat. The warmest jumper in my closet and probably my best friend during the cold winter day). I also loved the Ploonk sweaters and the Eksimo t-shirts and vests.</p>
<p>And last but not least, it&#8217;s so good to visit a shop where not everything is made in China.</p>
<p>118 Rue de Flandre, open Tuesday-Saturday between 11.00-19.00</p>

It belongs to Pika Pika Japan, a new shop selling toys, items and clothes all the way from Japan. <span id="more-1856"></span></p>
<p>A while ago, there was a similar shop with the same name (and by the same owner) down Rue Lombard in the city centre. I never walked in the shop, but the day I was planning to do so, it was shut. When walking on Chaussée de Waterloo one day, (on my way to <a title="Bang Bang" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/%3Fp=665">Bang Bang</a>, to be precise), I noticed this new shop and walked in right away.</p>
<p>Lots of colours, lots of shapes, lots of cute little toys staring at you with big eyes. Inflatable animals, notebooks, mobile phone pendants, socks, piggy banks, stickers, markers &#8230; an incredible selection of Japanese stuff. If you&#8217;re not sure what you&#8217;re looking at, the owner and the shop assistant have tons of stories to tell.</p>
<p>I loved the little green and orange bird that tweeted every now and again, when  somebody walks passed it. But eventually left the shop with a bright red Kewpie, a plastic adorable little figurine, with wings and big eyes. It doesn&#8217;t do anything, but when I look at it, I cannot but smile.</p>
<p>Note: Everything is directly imported from Japan, which explains the price. Nothing it too expensive, though.</p>
<p>525 a, Chaussée de Waterloo, open every day but Sunday, between 11.00-19.00</p>

But when I visited the place, I discovered it was small, full of charisma and with a lovely selection of clothes, accessories and furniture.<span id="more-1838"></span></p>
<p>För means travel in Icelandic. The owner of the shop developed a passion for the country and wanted to bring some of its nordic spirit to Brussels. Great idea, as I&#8217;m quite a fan of clever Scandinavian design too. The yellow raincoat on the picture is one by Rains, a Danish brand with the best looking raincoats ever. They come in several colours and are available at För. I-love-them!</p>
<p>On the racks: Levi&#8217;s Made and Crafted and Question Of (organic cotton t-shirts and more) and more brands to come. I was particularly interested in the small food corner, where you&#8217;ll find Kvass (a Russian grain lemonade) and Icelandic salt. The furniture is up for sale as well, vintage finds from the Antwerp-based shop 1000designs.</p>
<p>All this in a space not much bigger than your average living room. You have to see it to believe it!</p>
<p>And downstairs, there&#8217;s more. The basement is used for art exhibitions and event. Great stuff!</p>
<p>108 Rue Africaine, open Monday until Saturday between 11.00-18.00</p>

Located in the Dansaert area, Siblingsfactory is a stunning concept store with some great fashion labels, vintage furniture, magazines and a cool bunch of large cacti (yes, they deserve a mention too).<span id="more-1829"></span></p>
<p>The shop is owned by Aymeric Watine and Marie de Moussac. This French duo of soul mates teamed up with Brussels architect Julien De Smedt for the design of the shop. All eyes go to the walking bridge and the cacti on the first floor. I&#8217;m a bit afraid of heights, but I did get up there and rushed from the one side to the other. (As I was told by Aymeric later, the construction can take 500 kilo per square meter, no worries there).</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk clothes. I&#8217;m a big knitwear fan so I&#8217;m delighted the shop stocks Le Mont Saint Michel. In the men section upstairs, more lovely jumpers by the Danish Mads Nørgaard. Jeans are by the label Reiko and I was quite intrigued by the jewellery by Yvonne Léon.</p>
<p>With a great selection of vintage (but pricey) furniture, magazines and a coffee corner, the shop has got everything for a great shopping experience. I was impressed after my first visit, and am looking forward to my next visit.</p>

It&#8217;s called Kure and sells a mix of great Scandinavian and French brands, lovely accessories, industrial furniture and art. <span id="more-1817"></span></p>
<p>Multi-brand shops are my favourites. There&#8217;s a little bit of everything and they&#8217;re the perfect place to discover new labels.</p>
<p>Kure opened where the old G-Star shop was, in an old, huge building with two floors, bare brick walls and white ceilings. Amongst the many brands, a couple of great names such as Vanessa Bruno and American Retro. A few labels I had heard of before but never tried myself, such as Hope and Margaux Lonnberg and a couple of names that were completely new to me such as Anine Bing and Ganni.</p>
<p>The style of the clothing is very cool and temporary. Think of white tops and t-shirts, sweaters, black skinny trousers and leather jackets. There are some on-trend pieces as well, such as a checked woollen oversized coat, royal blue fluffy jumpers or flat leopatd boots.</p>
<p>I was very happy to see Kure stocked Fashionology as well, a Dutch jewellery label. Affordable rings, necklaces and bracelets, I had checked out on their website before but never made up my mind. I went home with a small selection of my favourite pieces, and have the feeling my collection will grow soon.</p>
<p>The shop has a little garden too, where you can sit down, read magazines or have a drink.</p>
<p>Note: only women&#8217;s clothing at the moment, but there will be stuff for men as well.</p>
<p>48 Rue Antoine Dansaert, open Monday until Saturday, between 10.30-19.00</p>

And while I really don&#8217;t need anything at all (in fact, the one thing I truly do need would be an extra wardrobe), I will probably have a look at all my favourite shops to see if they have anything left from my wishlist, in my size (and at a stiff discount).<span id="more-1765"></span></p>
<p>As summer kicked in late (euphemism), I&#8217;m guessing all shops will have a huge stock left. And even though some have already started clearing their stock room via private sales over the last few weeks, the official sales only start on Monday July 1.</p>
<p>Uptown I&#8217;ll pop into the new <a title="Village Verve" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/%3Fp=1598">Village Verve</a> to check if they still have that gorgeous Dagmar summer dress in my size. On my way to Avenue Louise, I&#8217;ll check what <a title="No Concept" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/%3Fp=44">No Concept</a> has to offer, followed by <a title="Louise 54" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/%3Fp=1065">Louise 54</a>. I love that shop for their great selection, but obviously I can&#8217;t afford most of what they sell. Sales times are different though, we&#8217;ll see.</p>
<p>I usually end up in <a title="Zara Home" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/%3Fp=684">Zara Home</a> as well, stocking up on candles and peculiar coffee cups (I seem to have started a collection). I avoid the high-end boutiques on Boulevard de Waterloo, but will have a peek at <a title="Autour du Monde" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/%3Fp=1115">Bensimon&#8217;s</a> and the Kenzo boutique (love their knitwear) down Rue de Namur.</p>
<p>After all this, I guess a lunch/coffee break is in order. The new <a title="Jat’ Café" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/%3Fp=1696">Jat&#8217; Café</a> could be the ideal location to rest my legs for a bit, before walking down to the shops around Dansaert.</p>
<p>In the city centre, <a title="Icon" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/%3Fp=632">Icon</a> is on top of my list. I&#8217;m not eyeing anything in particular, but during sales I always spot things I didn&#8217;t see throughout the season. <a title="Hunting and Collecting" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/%3Fp=508">Hunting and Collecting </a>will get a visit too, for the same reason (and perhaps another Carven skirt, love them). And I&#8217;ll check Espace Bizarre for more home deco, because I like everything they have in store.</p>
<p>Probably followed by another coffee break at <a title="AM Sweet" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/%3Fp=334">AM Sweet</a>.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the plan, but I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ll be popping in and out of many other boutiques as well. What about you?</p>
