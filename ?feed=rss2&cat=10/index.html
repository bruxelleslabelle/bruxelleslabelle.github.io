<p>The shop is located where <a title="Must" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/%3Fp=1210">Must </a>used to be. New owners, but still great shoes.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a big fan of Rupet Sanderson heels, I love the Robert Clergerie brogues and Avril Gau shoes are probably my most comfortable flats. Après la Pluie knows what women want, and manages to pick the best pairs of all designers every season.</p>
<p>Note: Come prepared with a bit of a budget, because designer shoes don&#8217;t come cheap.</p>
<p>37 Rue Darwin, open from Tuesday until Saturday between 11.00-19.00 and Sunday between 14.00-18.00</p>

<p>After two shops downtown, <a title="Village Verve" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/%3Fp=649">Village Verve</a> is trying its luck on the other side of Brussels too. Good news for the area and its many shoppers, as most of the brands sold at the shop weren&#8217;t available anywhere near.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m particularly happy with MM6 (Maison Margiela&#8217;s affordable line), I love the jersey jumpers, dresses and the shoes (oh, the shoes). The quirky and corlourful creations of JC de Castelbajac are great too, and I think I&#8217;ll need to keep an eye on the collection by Damir Doma, just my cup of tea.</p>
<p>The shop is quite big, and even has a little &#8216;garden&#8217; as well. Go check it out when you&#8217;re next in the area, you won&#8217;t regret it.</p>
<p>49 Rue du Bailli, open from Tuesday until Saturday, between 11.00-19.00</p>

Not anymore unfortunately. Luckily there&#8217;s a large selection available via FamousBox. Yes, an online shop, but they&#8217;re based in Brussels!<span id="more-1390"></span></p>
<p>I heard of this Belgian webshop a while ago, but never really took the time to check it out. Until I really wanted a Mellow Yellow pair of shoes, and found it on Famousbox. I filled and emptied my online shopping basket a couple of times, and ended up choosing two lovely pair (I know, two!!).</p>
<p>Delivery options include Kiala drop-off points. Good news, as I always have my online goodies delivered at my boyfriend&#8217;s work address. Practical, but it has got one big downside: he knows what I&#8217;m buying. The nearest Kiala point is located a stone&#8217;s throw away from home, so it couldn&#8217;t be more convenient.</p>
<p>Ordered on Sunday, and delivered on Tuesday. How about that? Unfortunately I had to send one pair back, but the exchange policy is dead easy, so no problem there.</p>
<p>FamousBox has clothes, shoes and accessories for both women and men. They stock some great brands including American Vintage, Levi&#8217;s, Essentiel, Marcel de Bruxelles and more. And the best news: they&#8217;re open DAY AND NIGHT, ha!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Marc-by-Marc.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1352" title="Marc by Marc" src="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Marc-by-Marc-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>And there it is. Finally. A post on the Marc by Marc Jacobs store. The shop opening got delayed by more than a year, but the entire Marc by Marc Jacobs collection is now available in Brussels.<span id="more-1351"></span></p>
<p>There were many rumours as to why it took so long, but let&#8217;s forget about those. The shop is open and that&#8217;s all that matters. If you&#8217;re a fan of the brand, that is.</p>
<p>On the ground floor, you&#8217;ll find women&#8217;s clothes, shoes, watches, perfumes, bags and accessories. On the top floor, you&#8217;ll have the men&#8217;s collection, kids collection as well as BookMarc, a selection of books and stationary items.</p>
<p>The friendly sales man told me the top floor will get a bar as well. As of November, you can join &#8216;Marc&#8217; for a drink. Sounds fun!</p>
<p>And as for the looks of the shop &#8230; it&#8217;s a complete different story than in Paris. Over there, the shop is dark and has got something of a thrift shop. The one in Brussels is light and spacey, the way all the new MBMJ shop look like these days.</p>
<p>So what do you think? What is worth the wait? I quite like the shop, and think it&#8217;s a good addition to the area. After all, Brussels is the capital of Europe, so we should have all the big designer shops, no?</p>
<p>90 Rue Antoine Dansaert, open EVERY DAY between 12.00-20.00</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/sales2.png"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1138" title="sales" src="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/sales2-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>During the month of July, nearly every shop in Brussels will be clearing its stock. The summer sales equal great bargains, but also long queues at the fitting rooms and cash desks. Here are my favourite shops to score a good deal.<span id="more-1134"></span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">I love clothes, and living close to the shoppers paradise of Avenue Louise, tend to hit the stores more often than necessary. My preferred spot for basics must be <a title="COS" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/%3Fp=415" target="_blank">COS</a>, where the sales vary from -30% off to -70% (!) at the end of July. On their website, sales have started already -&gt; perfect if you&#8217;d like to see which items will be reduced.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">Also on my &#8216;must check for sales&#8217; list in the area: concept store <a title="No Concept" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/%3Fp=44" target="_blank">No Concept</a>, for its mix of brands including Bel Air and American Vintage. I can&#8217;t help but have a look at multi designer brand store <a title="Louise 54" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/%3Fp=1065" target="_blank">Louise 54</a> either. They&#8217;ve been clearing items for a while now, as they&#8217;re expanding the shop. But I checked, and there will be a lot more of the fancy designer work by Alexander Wang, Marni and Balenciaga on sale as off Saturday June 30.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">For underwear at half of the original price, I visit department store Inno on Avenue Louise. There are some great deals to be found on the -1 floor.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">When I&#8217;m in the city centre, I&#8217;ll have to pop into <a title="Privejoke" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/%3Fp=241" target="_blank">Privejoke</a> and hopefully score a great new pair of jeans. While I&#8217;m there, a visit to <a title="Village Verve" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/%3Fp=649" target="_blank">Village Verve</a> will be on the agenda as well. And last but not least, I&#8217;ll browse the boutiques on Rue Dansaert and will probably end up with some nice organic t-shirts from green fashion store <a title="Haleluja" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/%3Fp=64" target="_blank">Halelujah</a>.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">Concept store <a title="Graphie Sud" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/%3Fp=53" target="_blank">Graphie Sud</a> will get a visit too, both for its home decor objects as well as the pretty clothes by Isabel Marant and others. For shoes (even though I really don&#8217;t need another pair), I might try my luck at outlet shoe shop <a title="Dégriff" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/%3Fp=775" target="_blank">Degrif</a>f. On top of the usual discounts, you&#8217;ll get an extra sales reductions as well.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">The good news is: July is a long month, so I should have plenty of time to visit all the shops. The bad news is: if I do visit them all, I&#8217;ll probably be broker than broke. Hmmmm.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">Which stores are on your &#8216;sales shops&#8217; list?</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">Note: Yes I have a rather expensive taste, but no better time than the sales month to score great designs at small prices, right?</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>

It has been open for almost 40 years, and was founded by two friends whose father was called Edouard (hence the name). <span id="more-1122"></span></p>
<p>The shop is located in a beautiful and huge old mansion. That alone is worth a visit. Once inside, you&#8217;ll be overwhelmed by the racks of clothes. Trousers, blazers, skirts, dresses, shirts &#8230; there&#8217;s an overload of everything. From Chanel to Dries Van Noten, the list of designers and brands is endless too.</p>
<p>And when you think you&#8217;ll never be able to browse all the things on the ground floor, know that there&#8217;s a big staircase taking you to the second floor with even more clothes and shoes.</p>
<p>Accessories and handbags are displayed in pretty wooden cupboard and on shelves, and there are a couple of fitting rooms and enough mirrors to try stuff on.</p>
<p>A lot of the clothes and shoes come from people who sell them through the shop. If you have some pretty designers stuff in your wardrobe you longer wear or that no longer fits, make an appointment with the shop and let them sell it for you. Modern recycling.</p>
<p>Note: I only visited the shop for women, but there&#8217;s one for men too, just next door.</p>
<p>175-177 Avenue Louise, open from Monday until Saturday between 10.00-18.30</p>

The most famous items at the shop are the canvas &#8216;tennis&#8217; shoes, available in all colours of the rainbow.<span id="more-1115"></span></p>
<p>If I remember it correctly, Brussels had a Bensimon store at Place de Brouckère a couple of years ago. It closed its doors relatively quickly, and some time later, the concept store opened up Rue de Namur. A pretty shop, with clothes, accessories and shoes.</p>
<p>The style of the clothes is very laid-back. Casual t-shirts, shirts and pants, all with a good cut and in bright colours. Among the interior items, you&#8217;ll find lamps, Pantone mugs, and -it deserves a special mention, as it was love at first sight &#8211; a red, knitted, lobster pillow.</p>
<p>The canvas shoes are piled up on a long table, per size. They cost around 50 euro (not bad!) and are available for men, women and kids. Summer on your feet.</p>
<p>70, Rue de Namur, open from Monday until Saturday, 10.00-18.30</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/louise-541.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1066" title="louise 54" src="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/louise-541-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>Probably Brussels most fancy multi-brand store, with all the top brands you read about in high end fashion magazines. Céline, Balenciaga, Marc Jacobs, Marni, Alexander McQueen …. pretty!<span id="more-1065"></span></p>
<p>Louise 54 isn’t the kind of shop where you pop in every week to see what’s new. Neither is it the kind of shop were you can enjoy some serious window shopping, as the display is always minimal. To me, it’s the kind of shop where you go once or twice a year, to admire the clothes, finally hold that a-ma-zing bag and most of all, the kind of shop that makes you wish your bank balance was in better shape.</p>
<p>The YSL arty ring, those Balenciaga sandals, that pretty Céline bag, the Marni necklaces, Alexander Wang shirts …. what more can I say, the shop has them all. Even a doorman, who gives you a good look before he lets you in. I tell you, it’s an experience!</p>
<p>54 Avenue Louise, open from Monday until Saturday, between 10.00-18.30</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll find shoes for men and women, and a small range of sunglasses and accessories too.</p>
<p>On my last visit, I was very tempted by an all black pair of Anniel shoes, but my size was gone. I tried on a couple more shoes on the fancy leather sofa, but left empty-handed.</p>
<p>Friendly staff, pretty shop, gorgeous shoes &#8230; go!</p>
<p>21, Rue Léon Lepage, every day between 12.00-20.00</p>

The team opened a new shop in Uccle, including a little eatery and space for home decoration, on top of their ever-so-large range of clothes.<span id="more-983"></span></p>
<p>The shop opened a couple of weeks ago, but it took me a while to get there as it&#8217;s located in an area I rarely visit. But I finally made it!</p>
<p>I loved the entrance door. Might sound silly, but you actually have to pull down a handle to open the big glass door, rather than walking through an open door or waiting for the automatic ones to slide open. First thing you noticed is the eatery, where you can sit down for breakfast, lunch or afternoon cake. They serve salads, sandwiches and cupcakes, typical girl food! One wall of the eatery is dedicated to a selection of tea, jams, coffee syrups (by Monin) in all flavours etc, perfect if you&#8217;d like to play fancy tearoom in your own kitchen.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s only a few steps from the eatery to the clothes section, where you&#8217;ll find some great brands together: Zadig &amp; Voltaire, Bel Air, MiH, McQ by Alexander McQueen, American Vintage, Iro (and more)&#8230; and also some shoes by Marc by Marc Jacobs. The style of the items picked is the same as you&#8217;ll find in the other No Concept stores: a mix of great basics and more edgy/rock &amp; roll pieces. Perfect!</p>
<p>The last room of the shop is dedicated to your interior. Plates, glasses, mugs, candles and the like.</p>
<p>I was tempted by many things, but left the shop empty-handed (mainly because I&#8217;m under a self-imposed shopping ban). On my No Concept Market wish list: the red paprika jam from the eatery and the blue Bel Air jumper with golden elbow pads.</p>
<p>Look for No Concept on Facebook to stay updated on the new collection and the events.</p>
<p>Note: picture was taken from the No Concept Facebook page.</p>
<p>1449, Chaussée de Waterloo, open every day but Sunday between 10.30-18.30, eatery opens at 08.00</p>
