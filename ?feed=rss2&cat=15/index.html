				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Picard.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1407" title="Picard" alt="" src="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Picard-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a>Nearly every French person I know is raving about Picard, a French frozen food chain store. They opened their first shop in Woluwe a while ago, a bit out of the way &#8230; but two weeks ago, they opened in the Bascule area too. So I took my freezer bag out for a walk!<span id="more-1406"></span></p>
<p>We all know the empty fridge syndrome. It usually pops up at the end of the week or -even worse- during the weekend. If you&#8217;re lucky, there&#8217;s something edible lingering in the freezer&#8230;. but I must admit that the frozen food isle is one I usually avoid in the supermarket. (small freezer, can&#8217;t be bothered, etc).</p>
<p>But with so many people raving about Picard, I just had to check it out. I made some space in my mini freezer, and off I was. The shop in Uccle is only small, but you&#8217;d be surprise how much food goes into those big white freezers. Vegetables, fruit, soup mixes, ready-made soup, fish, meat, ready-made meals &#8230; everything! You can even buy your entire Christmas dinner there, frozen of course (canapés, starter and dessert included!)</p>
<p>I was a bit overwhelmed by the many freezers. While shopping, an elderly man was reading everything out loud, so I perfectly knew what to expect from the next freezer. I tried to make a practical selection, and went for a bag of wok vegetables, beef burgers, mini croissants (lazy Sunday, woohoo) and a tub of Bonne Maman milk jam ice cream. I paid just over 10 euro for the lot, which seems like a good deal.</p>
<p>I took home the Picard leaflet and discovered that there are a million more products available. I&#8217;m happy enough with the small selection in Uccle though, but those who&#8217;re after the whole range might want to check out the bigger shops. Or shop online and have their frozen goodies delivered.</p>
<p>Currently, there are six shops in Brussels:<br />
170 Avenue Georges Henri<br />
670 Chaussée de Waterloo<br />
14 Avenue Hinnisdael<br />
626 Chaussée d&#8217;Alsemberg<br />
525 Rue Léopold 1er<br />
135 Chaussée d&#8217;Ixelles</p>
<p>All shops are open on Monday from 13.00-20.00, from Tuesday until Saturday between 09.00-20.00 and on Sundays between 09.00-13.00</p>

I never had a specific reason to go to Rob&#8217;s Gourmet Markt: it&#8217;s miles away from where I live and I never &#8216;needed&#8217; anything from there either. So, one day I decided to make the trip and check out this high-end food hall.<span id="more-69"></span></p>
<p>I was sold as soon as I walked down alley number 1, which is the fancy tea alley. I love pretty tea boxes and special flavours. Rob has rows and rows of those boxes, Taylors of Harrogate, Kusmi, Mariage Frères, &#8230; I really had to pace myself to not pick a box of each!</p>
<p>The fruit and veg part is impressive, and looks so clean and untouched. The range of  cheese and cold meats is dazzling. The liquor alley makes you want to throw a cocktail party right away. The jars of spices and herbs are so pretty and colourful &#8230;And then there&#8217;s the chocolate and coffee rack &#8230; with a locked fridge storing Jamaica Mountain Blue coffee and other rare blends.</p>
<p>I ended up buying a few boxes of tea, a couple of chocolate bars and some Danish pastry by a renowned baker (as I was starving!). I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ll go there again soon (as it&#8217;s quite a trip with public transport + walking) , but it was quite an experience!</p>
<p>28, Boulevard de la Woluwe, open from Monday-Saturday, 09.00-19.00</p>
