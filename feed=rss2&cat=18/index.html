				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Picard.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1407" title="Picard" alt="" src="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Picard-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a>Nearly every French person I know is raving about Picard, a French frozen food chain store. They opened their first shop in Woluwe a while ago, a bit out of the way &#8230; but two weeks ago, they opened in the Bascule area too. So I took my freezer bag out for a walk!<span id="more-1406"></span></p>
<p>We all know the empty fridge syndrome. It usually pops up at the end of the week or -even worse- during the weekend. If you&#8217;re lucky, there&#8217;s something edible lingering in the freezer&#8230;. but I must admit that the frozen food isle is one I usually avoid in the supermarket. (small freezer, can&#8217;t be bothered, etc).</p>
<p>But with so many people raving about Picard, I just had to check it out. I made some space in my mini freezer, and off I was. The shop in Uccle is only small, but you&#8217;d be surprise how much food goes into those big white freezers. Vegetables, fruit, soup mixes, ready-made soup, fish, meat, ready-made meals &#8230; everything! You can even buy your entire Christmas dinner there, frozen of course (canapés, starter and dessert included!)</p>
<p>I was a bit overwhelmed by the many freezers. While shopping, an elderly man was reading everything out loud, so I perfectly knew what to expect from the next freezer. I tried to make a practical selection, and went for a bag of wok vegetables, beef burgers, mini croissants (lazy Sunday, woohoo) and a tub of Bonne Maman milk jam ice cream. I paid just over 10 euro for the lot, which seems like a good deal.</p>
<p>I took home the Picard leaflet and discovered that there are a million more products available. I&#8217;m happy enough with the small selection in Uccle though, but those who&#8217;re after the whole range might want to check out the bigger shops. Or shop online and have their frozen goodies delivered.</p>
<p>Currently, there are six shops in Brussels:<br />
170 Avenue Georges Henri<br />
670 Chaussée de Waterloo<br />
14 Avenue Hinnisdael<br />
626 Chaussée d&#8217;Alsemberg<br />
525 Rue Léopold 1er<br />
135 Chaussée d&#8217;Ixelles</p>
<p>All shops are open on Monday from 13.00-20.00, from Tuesday until Saturday between 09.00-20.00 and on Sundays between 09.00-13.00</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/wine-in-the-city.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1005" title="wine in the city" src="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/wine-in-the-city-e1335334998323-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>It&#8217;s a myth that wine shops only sell expensive bottles. With more and more specialised shops opening up, both good wine and good advice have become very accessible. <span id="more-1004"></span></p>
<p>Wine in the City opened a couple of years ago, on the bustling Place Reine Astrid (or Le Miroir) in Jette. The shop wanted to be accessible to everyone from the very beginning. They used to have one of those stick on screens on the window, to show customers what they had in store. Too often people did not dare to walk in to wine shops, ad they felt it would be too expensive or too chic.</p>
<p>The screen is gone, but the shop still has a very handy division system for its bottles. Everything is ranged per flavour. All the bottles to go with red meat for instance, or cheese, or dessert. If you still want advice from a sales person, that&#8217;s possible too of course.</p>
<p>The shop also comes with a little kitchen cooking up small dishes and tapas to go with a nice glass of wine. Eating customers sit on tables spread over the shop, and can enjoy the nice decor of wine bottles. Customers looking for a specific bottle of wine may find choosing a bit difficult, when eating people are sat in front of the racks &#8230; but that&#8217;s where the sales people come in.</p>
<p>Besides wine, you&#8217;ll also find some liquor and whisky, as well as fancy wine glasses, bottle openers and more wine-related tools.</p>
<p>34 Place Reine Astrid, open from Tuesday until Saturday, between 10.30-18.30</p>

It&#8217;s been there for more than 20 years, and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s changed much over time. Very charming.<span id="more-972"></span></p>
<p>The window displays a bit of everything, and from the wide range presented, you could think Finum is a large shop. But once you swing open the door, you notice there&#8217;s very little space to walk around. The shelves are packed with jams, rare liqueurs and yummy biscuits. Half of the space is dedicated to a little tea/coffee salon, offering seats to about 4 people at a time.</p>
<p>I was very pleased to see the whole range of my favorite tea brand Kusmi. There was a special offer on ginger bread (my favourite breakfast treat), and chose two loaves while the friendly shop lady explained a bit more about the different flavours.</p>
<p>As the shop has been there so long, the shop lady is quite a bit older than your usual sales person. She adapted her range to her older clientele, which means you&#8217;ll find lots of sugar free treats and some good old brand, wrapped in pretty tin boxes and all labelled with a golden Finum sticker and a hand written price tag. How lovely is that?</p>
<p>At the till -well, the counter, as there isn&#8217;t an actual till- I was tempted by some violet sweeties in a pretty box and some good old Dutch peppermint lozenges. Below the counter was a basket with Belgian flags, sold for 9 euro. That made me laugh.</p>
<p>There should be more shops like these around. I hope it stays there for a long time to come!</p>
<p>6 Rue Léon Théodore, open between 10.00-13.00 &amp; 13.30-18.00, closed on Sundays</p>

I walked into this shop years ago, and seem to pop in every time I&#8217;m in the area. Most of the times I leave empty-handed, but on good days, there are quite some bargains to be scored.<span id="more-365"></span></p>
<p>As I said, the shop is a bit weird. It starts when entering, and an enormous chandelier is hanging from the ceiling. Way too big for the narrow hall way.</p>
<p>Once inside the shop, you&#8217;ll notice a strange mix of dyed fabrics, &#8216;plastic&#8217; leather bags and belts, and rows of cheap dresses and skirts. The more you walk to the back of the shop, the more interesting it gets. There are a few racks with last season&#8217;s (or even last year&#8217;s) collections by Replay, G-Star, Diesel and sometimes even Filippa K. God knows where these clothes come from, but they are sold at an incredible discount!</p>
<p>Underneath the racks, you&#8217;ll find shoes. An even weirder assortment of cowboy boots, Havaianas (at 12 euro a pair!), Birkenstock sandals, Converse trainers, stilettos and much more. Guys can choose between Gola trainers, Paul Smith shoes, cowboy boots or flipflops. See what I mean, strange eh?</p>
<p>220, Avenue de Jette, open every day but Monday, open on Sundays as long as the market is on</p>

I do mind, so in my quest for chairs to go with our dining table, I ended up at Momentum.<span id="more-293"></span></p>
<p>The shop is located in an old mansion with many rooms. Each of them is packed with furniture and accessories for the dining room, living room, bedroom etc.</p>
<p>From sixties to kitch, romantic to modern, cosy to classic, there is something out there for every style. They store a few brands such as Henders &amp; Hazel (wooden) and Kare Design (&#8216;plastic&#8217;).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying Momentum is a cheap shop, but most of the things are affordable (or become affordable during sales). I ended leaving the shop with 4 retro Kare chairs, very pleased with them.</p>
<p>Oh, and a very big bonus is the super friendly staff and the fact that they&#8217;re open on Sundays (when the market is on).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>594, Chaussée de Jette, open from Monday until Saturday between 10.00-18.30 on Sundays between 10.00-13.30.</p>
