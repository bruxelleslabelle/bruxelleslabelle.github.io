				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/delbove.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1751" alt="delbove" src="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/delbove-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a>This new beauty shop in Ixelles is a gem! Natural skin care, made and developed in Belgium by Madame Delbôve about 50 years ago and now relaunched by Gina, one of her loyal customers. The boutique&#8217;s best seller is the &#8216;Crème sorcière&#8217; (witch cream), a formula so effective somebody once referred to it as witch craft. <span id="more-1750"></span></p>
<p>Madame Delbôve used to run a beauty shop in Uccle, where she sold her lotions and potions. She believes the skin is a vital organ and needs to be treated with adequate care. Rather than developing creams for every skin kind, she is convinces all skin types need the same care, although some may need some after care.</p>
<p>The magic combo is the Eau Sorcière followed or mixed with the Crème Sorcière. Diluted you can use it as a make-up remover for instance. You can wash your face and neck with it, and use it as a hydrating cream. The secret ingredients are natural oils in a high dosage (and yes, they&#8217;re organic, even though the products aren&#8217;t labeled as such).</p>
<p>The entire range of products includes masks, eye creams, shower gels, hand and feet creams and much more. They all come in pharmacy-like looking packages with a slight retro feel. So does the entire shop actually. It&#8217;s located on the corner of Chaussée de Vleurgat and Rue de l&#8217;Abbaye, and you have to follow the elegant arrow to find the front door. Once inside, stylish shelves display the magic potions. There are sheets with information and tips on how to use the products, but you&#8217;ll get an overload of info from Gina and her colleague.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait to try the Crème de Sorcière and see some result. Some of the Delbôve customers have been using the creams for decades and are said to have an amazing skin. Hope it works for me too!</p>
<p>67 Rue de l&#8217;Abbaye, open Tue, Thursday, Friday and Saterday between 10.30-12.30 &amp; 13.00-18.00</p>

The store is open to everybody and you&#8217;ll find litres of lotions and potions, normally only available at hair salons. Shampoos, hair dyes, brushes, extensions, straighteners, they have it all.<span id="more-1735"></span></p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t really looking for anything in particular, but having walking passed Hairdis on numerous occasions, I figured it was time to see what it was all about.</p>
<p>The shelves are packed with shampoos, conditioners, serums and other hair care by famous brands as L&#8217;Oreal Professional, Wella and Schwarzkopf (and many more), and blowdryers and straighteners by Babyliss. There&#8217;s a very large large offer of hair dyes and bleach as well, but unless you know (someone who knows what they&#8217;re) you&#8217;re doing, I recommend you get some advice on what colours to pick and how to go about it. Same thing goes for the keratin treatments available, meant to feed you hair with a keratin boost as to relax it and end up with straight hair. (Growing up in the nineties I&#8217;ve attempted quite a few hair colour changes myself, more than often ending up with me not daring to remove the towel from my head and my dad laughing. Trust me, some thing are better left to professionals.)</p>
<p>On to hair accessories then. Lots and lots of combs and brushes. I was particularly pleased to see some Mason Pearson ones as well. They&#8217;re meant to last forever (craftsmanship form London) but come with a price tag easily ten times more expensive than an ordinary brush. If you can&#8217;t be bothered growing your hair, there are extensions in a myriad of colours, and all sorts of pins and clips to keep them up.</p>
<p>More professional gear included capes, chairs, trolleys and lots of make-up to finish up your new look.</p>
<p>Price-wise? You&#8217;ll pay more than at your chemist (makes sense, as he won&#8217;t sell the professional stuff), but definitely less than at your hair dresser&#8217;s. Unlike at the latter, you&#8217;re not tempted/pushed into buying products, but at the same time, you don&#8217;t really get to test them either. Luckily the staff knows what they&#8217;re selling, and help you out when you can&#8217;t choose.</p>
<p>Note: while in the shop, I overheard the sales man say a new Hairdis would open soon near Madou.</p>
<p>69 Chaussée de Charleroi, open during the week from 09.00-19.00 and on Saturday from 10.00-19.00</p>

Owners Melanie and Daniel try to offer products without nasty chemicals, but only on the condition they truly work.<span id="more-1705"></span></p>
<p>The shop has been open since the start of 2013, but I never made it there until recently. It&#8217;s located in Fort Jaco, an area not usually on my &#8216;wander about&#8217; path. But it&#8217;s a good idea to venture out there every now and then, and visit Freshlab for instance (also, located straight across from <a title="No Concept Market" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/p=983">No Concept Market</a>).</p>
<p>Freshlab stocks some great perfume brands, such as Odin, Miller Harris and Bond No 9. I found it very difficult to pick a favourite, and describing my favourite smell didn&#8217;t help either, as I had no clue how to start.</p>
<p>On to cosmetics then. Nail varnish in all colours by Kure, the only one without formaldehyde. Or soap by Les Savonneries Bruxelloises, their black rose soap blocks smell divine! Hair care comes in bottles labelled Philip B, the Hollywood hairdresser. With luxurious ingredients such as white truffle and mysterious names as Russian amber, the hair lotions have become many women&#8217;s favourite. For everyday facial creams, there&#8217;s the well known brand Ren (another of my favourites), and for a treatment during the weekend, they sell Glamglow, which is supposed to give you sexy skin.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot more available in the shop, and the range keeps expanding. You get great advice, aren&#8217;t pushed into buying and get a set of samples to try at home!</p>
<p>Note: If you love the &#8216;healthy cosmetics&#8217; approach, but find Uccle a bit far, try <a title="La Feuille" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/p=152">La Feuille</a> near Place Brugmann or <a title="Beauty by Kroonen &amp; Brown" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/p=1436">Beauty by Kroonen and Brown</a> in the city centre.</p>
<p>1482 Chaussée de Waterloo, open from Monday until Saturday, between 10.30-18.30</p>

Bad idea. I left the salon with a colour I didn&#8217;t like at all.  To get things back to normal, a friend suggested her hairdresser, Stephan Wagner. Now, that was a really good idea!<span id="more-1672"></span></p>
<p>I made an appointment in the morning, and sat down in the salon a couple of hours later. I explained my previous hair disaster, which left my hair with peroxide blonde streaks with very few locks of my natural colour. The irregularity of highlights made it even worse. (I went to a renowned hairdresser&#8217;s, but I guess the woman who did my hair must have had a bad day).</p>
<p>Anyway, at Stephan Wagner, colourist Lynn was very nice and saw immediately what was wrong. She suggested how she&#8217;d tackle the ordeal and I agreed. A good half an hour later, the moment of truth. It&#8217;s always a bit scary, those few seconds before they take off the towel and your wet hair reveals your new colour.</p>
<p>But this time, I could see right away that it looked exactly like what I was hoping for. Danielle, co-owner of the salon took over and treated my locks to a professional brushing. We even discussed hair action plans for the future (because yes, I&#8217;ll be going back to their salon). Thanks a lot!</p>
<p>Note: open on Mondays too, rare for a hairdresser!</p>
<p>219 Avenue Brugmann, open from Monday until Saturday between 9.30-18.30</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/beauty.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1437" title="beauty" alt="" src="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/beauty-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a>Beauty by Kroonen &amp; Brown is a wonderful beauty shop, located a stone&#8217;s throw away from Grand Sablon. It was founded by Ioana Kroonen and Els Debruyn (hence the name), two lovely ladies with a shared passion for niche perfumes and natural make-up.<span id="more-1436"></span></p>
<p>I never thought it would be possible to spend over an hour in a beauty shop. But when a friend (she&#8217;s a beauty journalist) introduced me to this one, I quickly realised that time flies by when you&#8217;re in good hands. I got a introduction to nearly all the lotions and potions in the shop, and an answer to many of my (silly) beauty questions. Els suggested I&#8217;d make an appointment for a make-up workshop, so she could explain more about it without keeping the other customers waiting.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s what I did, about a week later. We first enjoyed a cup of coffee and chitchat. I think this is where she scans you and learns a bit more about your character, to see what kind of make-up girl you are. (I could be wrong, obviously) I complained about my small eyes, pale complexion and short eyelashes. And Els promised to deal with all of that.</p>
<p>Firstly, she took off all my make-up. Then prepared my face with a moisturiser by Environ (a South African brand). Every step came with an explanation of the product used (no sales talk). Before applying the make-up, she introduced me to Jane Iredale, a make-up brand with natural and mineral ingredients. The only one approved by the skin cancer foundation. I was very interested in all this, as I guess I never really realised how many crappy (but expensive!!) products I smear on my face every day.</p>
<p>I learned that my eyes aren&#8217;t small, but round. Which is great if you like to put on a fair bit of eyeshadow. It&#8217;s also not such a bad thing to have a pale skin, as it turns out to be easier to get the right foundation. And also, my lashes aren&#8217;t short, they&#8217;re just blonde and therefor semi-invisible.</p>
<p>About half an hour later, I was very happy with the result in the mirror. My skin looked very natural and my eyes popped out, just the way I like it. I received a sheet with all the products she used, which is now my Christmas wish list (true story!).</p>
<p>After the make-up session, I couldn&#8217;t resist smelling their range of perfumes. From the Swedish pretty bottles by Byredo, to the exclusive and exotic fragrances of Amouage and the more popular smells of Juliette has a gun.</p>
<p>A true revelation, this shop. I left empty-handed though (because one of the products I really wanted was temporarily out of stock, not because I suddenly managed to control my impulsive shopping behaviour). I&#8217;ll be back soon to pick up my parcel, and already predict that leaving with just the one item is going to be difficult. Very difficult.</p>
<p>New at the shop: MUD make-up, from the Make-Up Designory School in Hollywood. A range of products, developed by and for professionals &#8230; and now available for everybody. Great colours, bursting with pigment (so very long-lasting) at a good price, and as always, with great advice.</p>
<p>49 Rue Lebeau, 1000 Brussels, open from Tuesday until Saturday, between 10.30-18.30 and on Sundays between 12.00-16.00</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Herboristerie-moderne.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1285" title="Herboristerie moderne" src="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Herboristerie-moderne-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>This little boutique in the city centre is packed with things that are good for you: teas, natural soap, herbal essences, oils and much more. <span id="more-1284"></span></p>
<p>Firstly, this shop is heaven for tea lovers. Stored in large metal boxes, or brightly coloured cardboard packages, there is an enormous choice out there. Many herbal teas, of course, and most of them are organic as well. The shop ladies are more than happy to explain all about them, and will even share some of there recipes. (Home made ice cold herbal tea, sounds good to me!)</p>
<p>Secondly, they have a large range of organic cosmetics. Think big chunks of soap (Aleppo) soap, argan oil, and all-natural lotions and potions.</p>
<p>For those wanting to know more about herbal remedies, there are seeds available to grow at home (fresh plants in season), books with everything you need to know about the powers of natural treatments, and all sorts of accessories.</p>
<p>Congratulations on the young owners to make this shop a bubbly place. There&#8217;s nothing boring about tea and herbs (at least, not at Herboristerie Moderne!)</p>
<p>Note; I took the picture from the Herboristerie Moderne website.</p>
<p>87 Rue Marché au Charbon, open from Tuesday until Saturday between 11.00-13.00 &amp; 14.00-18.00, on Sundays between 14.00-18.00</p>

My daily lotions and potions include an all-black mascara and some blush. That&#8217;s it.  But dear me, finding a good mascara is not as easy as most tv commercials make it look like.<span id="more-1192"></span></p>
<p>When I walked passed Make Up For Ever on Rue du Midi last weekend, it started raining. I decided I needed a place to shelter, and where better to hide than in a shop with lots of good stuff?</p>
<p>Make Up For Ever is known for its professional products, used on movie sets and for fancy photo shoots. But they have a &#8216;normal range&#8217; for everyday use as well. Perfect for mortals like me, who want long and full eye lashes without looking sleazy.</p>
<p>The lovely make-up girl suggested I&#8217;d go for the lengthening mascara, which turned out to be a very good choice. The brush is really small and thin, but easy to use and gets a great result in only a few strokes.</p>
<p>They have the most amazing range of blushes and foundations, brushes and sponges as well. And for those who&#8217;d love to go all the way, why not go for coloured lenses or eyeshadow in every shade of the rainbow? For more daring looks and long lasting professional products, Make Up For Ever opened a second shop in the city, near Mont des Arts.</p>
<p>And the price? More than in drugstores or supermarkets, less than in most perfume shops.</p>
<p>Note: this was post number 200, times flies!</p>
<p>18-19, Mont des Arts, 1000 Brussels<br />
62 Rue du Midi, 1000 Brussel; both closed on Sundays</p>

<p>When I heard of the shop I was very eager to check it out. The hand made soap in particular was what drew me there. Brussels has got of few other &#8216;hand made soap shop&#8217; that you can smell from miles away (you know which one I&#8217;m talking about, right), and I wanted to see what the new one had to offer.</p>
<p>First of all, there was no intensely sweet smell coming from the shop, neither were the blocks of soap blue or bright green. They were, as depicted, normal soap coloured, decorated with dried flowers. The soap is made by a women in Paris, who comes to the shop on occasions to give &#8216;make your own soap&#8217; workshops.</p>
<p>I was very pleased to see the whole range of Dr Haushka products as well. I&#8217;m a fan of the rose cream, and was tempted to try a bit more of the range as well.</p>
<p>The shop sells natural cosmetics too and the two shop ladies know all about the special characteristics of essential oils. Great!</p>
<p>Note: the work shops cost around 25 euro per session and are organised throughout the week. Despite it being a new shop, they sell out quickly. More info via their website.</p>
<p>60 Rue Simonis, open from Tuesday until Saturday, between 10.30-18.30</p>

<p><span id="more-452"></span></p>
<p>Dark chocolate, olive oil, peanut butter, wine, beers, banana crisps or rice &#8230; if I find the time, I prefer to get all of these products at Ozfair. They&#8217;re a bit more expensive than at the local supermarket, but in exchange you buy a product that hopefully helps a local farmer on the other side of the world.</p>
<p>I often hear people complaining about the taste of fair trade food, but I don&#8217;t agree. True, when shops like Oxfam first started selling food, taste wasn&#8217;t always everything (I have horrible memories of the sour orange juice and sand-like tasting chocolate). But believe me, the quality of the products sold at fair trade shops has gone up a lot.</p>
<p>Just try a few things, discover new flavours and give it a chance! My favourite place to shop such flavours is at Ozfair. And while I&#8217;m there, I always check the rest of the shop for cute accessories, decorative things for the house, candles or even toys for kids. They even sell make-up, too.</p>
<p>Ozfair serves breakfast, brunch and lunch &#8230; I&#8217;ve never eaten on their terrace, but it looks always pretty crowded&#8230;that must be a good thing!</p>
<p>9, Avenue Jean Volders, open from Monday until Saturday, from 09.00-18.30</p>

I do have one precious ring I could never do without, made by the Brussels-based designer Christa Reniers.<span id="more-394"></span></p>
<p>She used to have one shop, at the start of Rue Dansaert. A couple of years ago, she moved towards the end of that street and last year she opened a second shop near Sablon.</p>
<p>Both shops are really pretty, and allow the full focus on the jewelry. She&#8217;s most famous for her rings (in silver or gold), but has necklaces, bracelets and earrings too.</p>
<p>All the creations look very straightforward, but are incredibly detailed. My ring for instance, is a set of ten different small silver rings, tied together at the back.</p>
<p>On top of that, service is impeccable. Recently she even opened a webshop, which is a great way to start choosing!</p>
<p>196, Rue Dansaert, open Monday until Saturday, 10.00-13.00 &amp; 14.00-18.30<br />
61, Rue Lebau</p>
