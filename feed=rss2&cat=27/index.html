And down Rue Vanderkindere, <a title="Zizi" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/p=382">Glacier Zizi</a> and Il Gelato are stiff competitors. When one day, the queue at Zizi really was way too long, I joined the shorter queue at Il Gelato.<span id="more-1834"></span></p>
<p>And I wasn&#8217;t disappointed. The choice of Italian ice cream flavours was huge, the scoops generous and the taste delicious. I opted for dulce de leche and moka, just perfect.</p>
<p>Il Gelato opened first in 1990 and has expanded a fair bit since, with a booth in both Westland and Woluwé Shopping centre, and a parlour outside Brussels in Louvain-La-Neuve.</p>
<p>They serve large ice cream concoction too, such as the &#8216;Bounty Coupe&#8217; with coconut and chocolate or &#8216;Fragolona&#8217; with vanilla and strawberry ice cream topped with lots of strawberries.</p>
<p>168 Rue Vanderkindere, open every day between +/- 10.00-23.00</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Picard.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1407" title="Picard" alt="" src="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Picard-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a>Nearly every French person I know is raving about Picard, a French frozen food chain store. They opened their first shop in Woluwe a while ago, a bit out of the way &#8230; but two weeks ago, they opened in the Bascule area too. So I took my freezer bag out for a walk!<span id="more-1406"></span></p>
<p>We all know the empty fridge syndrome. It usually pops up at the end of the week or -even worse- during the weekend. If you&#8217;re lucky, there&#8217;s something edible lingering in the freezer&#8230;. but I must admit that the frozen food isle is one I usually avoid in the supermarket. (small freezer, can&#8217;t be bothered, etc).</p>
<p>But with so many people raving about Picard, I just had to check it out. I made some space in my mini freezer, and off I was. The shop in Uccle is only small, but you&#8217;d be surprise how much food goes into those big white freezers. Vegetables, fruit, soup mixes, ready-made soup, fish, meat, ready-made meals &#8230; everything! You can even buy your entire Christmas dinner there, frozen of course (canapés, starter and dessert included!)</p>
<p>I was a bit overwhelmed by the many freezers. While shopping, an elderly man was reading everything out loud, so I perfectly knew what to expect from the next freezer. I tried to make a practical selection, and went for a bag of wok vegetables, beef burgers, mini croissants (lazy Sunday, woohoo) and a tub of Bonne Maman milk jam ice cream. I paid just over 10 euro for the lot, which seems like a good deal.</p>
<p>I took home the Picard leaflet and discovered that there are a million more products available. I&#8217;m happy enough with the small selection in Uccle though, but those who&#8217;re after the whole range might want to check out the bigger shops. Or shop online and have their frozen goodies delivered.</p>
<p>Currently, there are six shops in Brussels:<br />
170 Avenue Georges Henri<br />
670 Chaussée de Waterloo<br />
14 Avenue Hinnisdael<br />
626 Chaussée d&#8217;Alsemberg<br />
525 Rue Léopold 1er<br />
135 Chaussée d&#8217;Ixelles</p>
<p>All shops are open on Monday from 13.00-20.00, from Tuesday until Saturday between 09.00-20.00 and on Sundays between 09.00-13.00</p>

Not anymore unfortunately. Luckily there&#8217;s a large selection available via FamousBox. Yes, an online shop, but they&#8217;re based in Brussels!<span id="more-1390"></span></p>
<p>I heard of this Belgian webshop a while ago, but never really took the time to check it out. Until I really wanted a Mellow Yellow pair of shoes, and found it on Famousbox. I filled and emptied my online shopping basket a couple of times, and ended up choosing two lovely pair (I know, two!!).</p>
<p>Delivery options include Kiala drop-off points. Good news, as I always have my online goodies delivered at my boyfriend&#8217;s work address. Practical, but it has got one big downside: he knows what I&#8217;m buying. The nearest Kiala point is located a stone&#8217;s throw away from home, so it couldn&#8217;t be more convenient.</p>
<p>Ordered on Sunday, and delivered on Tuesday. How about that? Unfortunately I had to send one pair back, but the exchange policy is dead easy, so no problem there.</p>
<p>FamousBox has clothes, shoes and accessories for both women and men. They stock some great brands including American Vintage, Levi&#8217;s, Essentiel, Marcel de Bruxelles and more. And the best news: they&#8217;re open DAY AND NIGHT, ha!</p>

Not only for its books, but also for its café/restaurant with a huge terrace outside.<span id="more-1096"></span></p>
<p>From comic books to coffee table books, French novels to English classics, kids literature and cookery or travel books &#8230; Name it, and you&#8217;ll probably find it at Cook &amp; Book. All different departments are cozily decorated, and in most of them you can sit down to eat, drink or read.</p>
<p>Cook &amp; Book comes with two restaurants as well. One with a brasserie menu, the other serving Italian-inspired food. If you eat inside, you can get your meal served in an old shiny aluminium caravan. i guess this would be the most popular seats in the area. But if you can&#8217;t sit there, there are plenty of other cozy nooks and crannies out there. On sunny days, the large terrace is heavenly. There are some lounge long chairs available as well, to relax in the most comfortable way.</p>
<p>The place is open on Sundays too, when you can brunch between 11.30-15.30 (breakfast is served on other days as of 08.00). Stroll around the book shop for hours, and you&#8217;ll probably end up finding lots of gift (ideas) too. An idea for next weekend?</p>
<p>1 Place du Temps Libre, open every day</p>
