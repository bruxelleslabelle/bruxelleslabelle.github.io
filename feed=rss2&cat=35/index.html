The Black Sheep behind Place Flagey has got both, and serves a mean burger to boot.<span id="more-2014"></span></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve visited The Black Sheep a couple of times now, and I felt a post was needed as the place got better every time.</p>
<p>On my first visit, my friends and I were after some comfort food and drinks on a rainy Sunday afternoon. We picked The Black Sheep, but had no idea what to expect. It&#8217;s definitely not your average English/Irish pub with wood cladded walls, carpet floors, Guinness memorabilia and &#8216;The Wild Rover&#8217; songs. The place is quite large actually, with seating available for just over 100 people at the same time. There&#8217;s a very large bar with well stocked fridges ( a varied choice of Belgian craft beers, the Brewdog UK range and much more). And, you can pay by card (hurray for that!)</p>
<p>First time there, we went for Fish &amp; Chips and a cocktail (or a fancy beer for the men). It did the trick. The place wasn&#8217;t very busy, but the staff were great, the cocktails were spot-on and the bill not too expensive.</p>
<p>One of the next visits was a Friday night. A completely different scene, with people dancing and very busy bar tenders. One of them suggested making me a &#8216;Tiramisu Martini&#8217;, which basically is a liquid dessert with cold coffee, cream and a fair bit of alcohol. Bonkers, but so good.</p>
<p>Our last visit definitely was the best one. Lured in by a new menu featuring burgers, chicken and fish and chips, my friends and I planned another trip on a Sunday evening. The ladies ordered cocktails (try the Bramble with gin and berry liqueur, 7,5 euro), the boys went for beers (try the Paix Dieu beer (10%), only brewed when there&#8217;s a full moon) and we ordered a platter of starters as well. Served on a wooden board, we got tempura vegetables with homemade dips, nacho crackers with cheese and mozzarella bread. The Black Sheep has a new chef who loves to make everything himself, which is great (and absolutely an upgrade from the usual pub grub).</p>
<p>We all ordered burgers (priced around 12 euro). The new menu has amongst others a classic version, the Ring of Fire (with chorizo) and the Jack Daniels (with whiskey marinated beef and bacon). Choosing is losing, and we all ended up with a different one. The buns (classic or rustic) were made with the chef&#8217;s own recipe and so was the meat. And the chips deserve a few lines of attention as well: they&#8217;re something in between potato wedges and french fries, deep fried in beef fat. Best (pub) fries ever!</p>
<p>To round up our greasy (but tasty!) Sunday, we got dessert as well. Vanilla ice cream fried in an oreo biscuit crust, a Ferrero Rocher mini muffin and a shot of Tiramisu Martini (hello again!). A bit much, but if you&#8217;re testing a new menu, you might as well do it right …. and we&#8217;ll definitely do it again.</p>
<p>Extra credits go to manager Chris and his team for making us feel very welcome and helping us pick the right food and drinks, the chef for choosing to make everything himself, and the playlist of the evening featuring a lot of Oasis.</p>
<p>Note: I snapped some pictures, but the evening light really didn&#8217;t do the food any justice.</p>
<p>Note2: Check The Black Sheep&#8217;s Facebook page for updates on parties, comedy nights, the new menu and much more.</p>
<p>8, Chaussée de Boondael, open Wed-Thu 17.00-01.00, Fri-Sat 17.00-03.00 and Sun 17.00-00.00</p>

King Kong settled down a couple of weeks ago, a Peruvian snack bar with a stunning decor.<span id="more-1962"></span></p>
<p>The main speciality on the menu is chicken. But somehow I was more temped by the hamburguesa (pictured): a crusty bun with a tasty burger, avocado, lettuce and a semi-spicy sauce. We ordered yuca chips and a side salad with it, and they were both a real treat. The former came with a pale sauce, of which I can&#8217;t come up with any other description than &#8216;nice&#8217;. Nothing more. The latter deserves a lot of credit, as it mixed tomatoes, salsa, quinoa, all sorts of beans and leaves. One of the best salads I&#8217;ve had in a while.</p>
<p>Upon my second visit -yes, I went twice already- I ordered the cold &#8216;pollo con mayonesa&#8217; sandwich. Which basically is a chicken mayo sandwich, but again with avocado and a special sauce. I liked it a lot too, and noticed that the size of the buns had about doubled since my last visit!</p>
<p>You order and pay at the counter, where you can see your food being cooked. There are quite a few tables, from cozy corners with wicker vintage chairs, to long wooden tables. The interior features lots of wood, dark green paint and plants everywhere (I loved the hanging baskets). At the back, there&#8217;s a great looking garden too with rocky wall. Unfortunately you can&#8217;t sit outside (yet).</p>
<p>Great place, great food.</p>
<p>227, Chaussée de Charleroi, open every day 12.00-15.00 &amp; 19.00-22.30 (Mon &amp; Sun, lunch only)</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll find L&#8217;Amour Fou near Place Fernand Cocq. It&#8217;s quite a large eatery, with burgers and salads on the menu. The bread buns are homemade, how nice is that? There&#8217;s an impressive cocktail and rum list too. Great spot for food AND drinks.</p>
<p>Their menu features banoffee pie as well, which we had to try of course. L&#8217;Amour Fou claims to be the only one serving it in Brussels, but I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ve seen it on the menu at <a title="Merrily’s" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/p=1">Merrily&#8217;s</a> too. (It was tasty, but served with too much whipped cream, also very, very sweet).</p>
<p>185 Chaussée d&#8217;Ixelles, open from 11.00-01.00 (Monday open as of 18.00, Friday and Saturday open until 03.00)</p>

And some good friends, comfort food and cocktails to forget about everything else. Hard Rock Café on Grand Place turned out to be the perfect place for all the above. (Yes, we did feel like tourists, but that&#8217;s part of the experience).<span id="more-1849"></span></p>
<p>When HRC just opened, I was invited to check out the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.247424302042904.54112.151415738310428&amp;type=3">memorabilia</a>. But that was over a year ago. When last week, my friend and I planned a much-needed catch-up, we wanted to go somewhere we could just sit and talk for a while, have some proper comfort food and wash it down with (a) cocktail(s).</p>
<p>I was in charge of finding the perfect location, and it didn&#8217;t take long before I realised it had to be Hard Rock Café. Where else can you shamelessly drink bright coloured cocktails in the middle of the afternoon and order large platters of American fast food? Everything is served with a smile (in a mix of English and French), with American video clips playing in the background, and tourists owing and awing at Madonna&#8217;s dress and many other idols&#8217; relics.</p>
<p>Not long after our cocktails appeared at the table (I forgot the names, but they were tasty!), our food came too. Fajitas for my friend, a pulled pork sandwich for me. The fries were crunchy (no mayonnaise though, but luckily you get some if you ask for it), the meat was soft and paired with the side salads, it ticked all the boxes (if anyone knows where else in Brussels they serve pulled pork, let me know!).</p>
<p>We chatted for hours, but had to realise at the end of the meal, that we couldn&#8217;t stomach dessert as well. Too bad, as HRC serves the most bombastic ice cream sundaes, with a cherry on top!</p>
<p>The waiters were &#8216;kind enough&#8217; to check every so often if we needed anything else, we heard some songs from when we were young and watched MTV as often as we could, checked the gift shop AND managed to leave empty-handed. Good times.</p>
<p>Note: cocktails cost around 8,5 euro (some even come with a HRC glass you can keep), food menu features all sorts of burgers, sandwiches and salads, all cost around 15-20 euro)</p>
<p>12a Grand Place, open every day between 12.00-23.00 (or 00.00 on Friday-Saturday). Gift shop opens every day at 10.00</p>

<p>All the items on the menu gave got funny names. But Britney Spears is my favourite: a bagels filled with chicken, cheddar cheese, bacon, salad and mayo. De-li-scious. You&#8217;ll get your bagel served with a side salad and very crunchy oven baked potato slices.</p>
<p>The list of burgers looks equally tasty, and they even have a vegetarian option as well (same for the bagels).</p>
<p>A drink included, I paid about ten euro for lunch that kept my tummy happy for the rest of the day. Thank you Rachel!</p>
<p>100 Rue de Marché au Charbon, open from Tuesday until Friday between 12.00-15.00 and 19.00-23.00 and on weekends from 12.00-23.00</p>

It comes with about 30 floors and the famous brasserie Café d&#8217;Egmont. Currently, some big renovation works are going on. And I was invited to see what exactly was going on.<span id="more-1366"></span></p>
<p>As soon as you walk into The Hotel, you notice that something is going on. The big spacious entrance hall is covered and you can hear knocking and drilling sounds. But I was told they&#8217;re ahead on schedule, which is good news. The renovation works were necessary, as the building was in desperate need of an internal face-lift. When Swedish hotel group Pandox bought the hotel from Hilton at the start of 2011, it planned a massive renovation of all the rooms, lobby and restaurant.</p>
<p>The famous Café d&#8217;Egmont on the ground floor, with its stunning interior is closed at the moment. But in exchange, The Hotel opened a temporary restaurant (open to everyone) with a buffet formula on the 26th floor. Indeed, a meal with a view. As my friend and I were secretly after The Hotel&#8217;s speciality (meat!), we were allowed in the Panorama Lounge on the 24th floor. A more exclusive eatery, only open to hotel guests. We had the famous steak tartar and a burger, both absolutely delicious.</p>
<p>Afterwards, we were treated to a tour around The Hotel. We noticed a lot of fashion books and magazines everywhere, references to the many luxury boutiques that surround The Hotel. Very nice. If you see something you like in the latest Vogue, chances are you&#8217;ll find it just outside The Hotel&#8217;s doors.</p>
<p>The new rooms look great. The colours are kept light and fresh (white, beige) and the furniture looks modern and comfortable. There&#8217;s a minibar too, of which the drinks are included in the room fee. We sure liked the sound of that!</p>
<p>But no, we didn&#8217;t spend the night there. We did, however, get access to the sauna on the 23rd floor (we got pampered, I know!). Imagine sitting in a 80°C sauna cabin with a view on Brussels.. It&#8217;s quite amazing. (There&#8217;s a fitness room a bit further, also with a panoramic view &#8230; but that did not tempt us as much as the sauna and hammam!)</p>
<p>Thank you, The Hotel, for a lovely lunch! I&#8217;m very curious to see what the newly renovated brasserie will bring!</p>
<p>38 Boulevard de Waterloo, open every day.</p>

<p>I used to work in the area, and de Valera&#8217;s was my favourite lunch place. Sitting outside with a cold drink, chatting with colleagues, nice. The menu at de Valera&#8217;s, doesn&#8217;t really read like an Irish one. It features salads, burgers and pasta, but if you look harder, you&#8217;ll see they serve bangers and mash as well.</p>
<p>The white wine (chardonnay) is great (and a big glass too), although I&#8217;m usually tempted to have a cider (as well).</p>
<p>The one thing that bugs me a bit, is the many tv screens, even on the terrace. But then again, it&#8217;s an Irish pub, what did I expect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>17, Place Flagey, open every day, from 11.00-00.00</p>

<p>There are all sorts of burgers to choose from, simple ones, cheese burgers, but also fancy lobster burgers with avocado, for instance.</p>
<p>All meals are served with a tasty coleslaw and onion rings. I don&#8217;t think I ever had those before, and expected a sloppy and chewy mess, but they were actually very crunchy and tasty.</p>
<p>Cool Bun has a soft spot for organic produce, which I believe is a bonus. The place is small, but the waiters are friendly and quick (we got served within fifteen minutes).</p>
<p>I drank wine with the burger, my male companions chose the beer of the week and loved it&#8230;</p>
<p>34, Rue Berckmans, closed on Monday</p>
