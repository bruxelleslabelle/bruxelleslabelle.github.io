				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/bake-window.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2042" src="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/bake-window-150x150.jpg" alt="bake window" width="150" height="150" /></a>BAKE is a small baking business run by Bérangère. She specialises in all things American (cookies, brownies and cakes, yum). And while she has no shop of her own, she sells her bakes at some of the city&#8217;s best coffee spots. And … she made bake-your-own cookie boxes, which I tried, tasted and loved!<span id="more-2041"></span></p>
<p>I first heard of BAKE when I visited Scandinavian interior and tea shop Hei. It&#8217;s one of the few spots where you can taste the delicious treats made by Bérangère. The other ones are APDM bagel bar, AMI, <a title="Chez Franz" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/p=1179">Chez Franz</a>, Vroom Vroom mobile coffee bar and Prélude. The last one, located in Saint-Gilles is where the BAKE headquarters are located, they share the same kitchen.</p>
<p>I was invited over earlier this week, an offer I couldn&#8217;t refuse. Those who know me know I loved to bake myself, so how could I refuse a peek into a professional kitchen? Bérangère introduced me to BAKE&#8217;s novelty for the Christmas season: a DIY box with all the ingredients to make chocolate chip cookies, the perfect gift for those with a sweet tooth. All you have to do is follow the recipe (included) and add butter and eggs.</p>
<p>I went home with a box and couldn&#8217;t wait to try!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Bake.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2043" src="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Bake.jpg" alt="Bake" width="653" height="653" /></a></p>
<p>Four pictures, it&#8217;s that easy! The recipe is for 12 large biscuits. I used half of everything to make 12 small ones, although they still turned out big. I&#8217;m not complaining. (And did you see how many chocolate chips there are?? They&#8217;re so good, and it&#8217;s hard to resist snacking on them while you&#8217;re waiting for the oven to heat up…)</p>
<p>The box costs 17 euro (if you pick it up at BAKE), 20 euro at Prélude, Hei or AMI.</p>

Sweet, creamy, crusty … it put a big smile on my face! This delicious custard tart is available from the Portuguese bakery on Chaussée de Charleroi.<span id="more-1937"></span></p>
<p>For years in a row, Forcado (then called &#8216;Le Petit Forcado&#8217;) was nothing more but a tiny shop with a hidden kitchen, where the Portuguese baker would spend most of his day making several batches of the pastels. There was no space to sit down and enjoy the treats with coffee. But when you visited the bakery, the owner would happily step out of his kitchen and explain all about his little tarts.</p>
<p>Last summer, Forcado expanded to a larger space a couple houses further up Chaussée de Charleroi (across from <a title="King Kong" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/p=1962">King Kong</a>), run by the son of the Portuguese baker. There&#8217;s a big counter with a varied choice in patels (classic one, with speculoos, with coffee, with fresh raspberries or lemon). There are gluten free little cakes too, flavoured with chocolate and orange. All made at the old Forcado, and brought to the shop by the dad (on his slippers!)</p>
<p>They go really well with a nice cup of coffee and are dangerously more-ish!</p>
<p>Treats come at +/- 1,7 euro each, and are worth every cent.</p>
<p>-&gt; More Portuguese food? Try the cozy tea-room<a title="Jynga" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/p=1536"> Jynga</a> or shop wines and condiments at <a title="The Sol Ar Store" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/p=1038">Sol Ar</a>.</p>
<p>196-198, Chaussée de Charleroi, open from Tuesday until Sunday, between 10.00-18.00</p>

This new-ish coffee bar deserves all the attention, as the brews (and the cakes) are delicious.<span id="more-1986"></span></p>
<p>You&#8217;ll find Bocca Moka on Chaussée de Charleroi, near great Thai place <a title="Premier Comptoir Thai" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/p=144">Premier Comptoir Thai</a>. You can&#8217;t miss the place, there&#8217;s usually a black board with funny quotes outside. It&#8217;s a spacious coffee bar with ample seating near the window, at the back, on the lower floor and in the garden (yes, there&#8217;s a terrace too).</p>
<p>While you can order a simple cappuccino or an espresso, I recommend you take the time to read the coffee menu and pick something new. A Japanese syphon coffee for instance, where a halogen lamp slowly heats the water and a perfect cup of coffee is prepared drip by drip. These so-called slow coffees are &#8216;a thing&#8217; nearly every where else in Europe, but luckily there are coffee bars in Brussels joining the movement as well. Slow drip coffees are very light in taste, but so full of flavour. It&#8217;s a new way of drinking of coffee, which requires utmost precision and timing while making it (you&#8217;ll see the barista weighing the ground coffee!), but it&#8217;s worth the wait.</p>
<p>Next on my &#8216;to-try list&#8217; : a barraquito, a coffee with condensed milk, foamed milk and cinnamon. Oh that, and a slice of apple pie!</p>
<p>Bocca Moka does great take-out coffee too, and has bagels for lunch.</p>
<p>41 Chaussée de Charleroi, open every day but Sunday from 07.30-18.00 (on Sat, as of 08.00)</p>

King Kong settled down a couple of weeks ago, a Peruvian snack bar with a stunning decor.<span id="more-1962"></span></p>
<p>The main speciality on the menu is chicken. But somehow I was more temped by the hamburguesa (pictured): a crusty bun with a tasty burger, avocado, lettuce and a semi-spicy sauce. We ordered yuca chips and a side salad with it, and they were both a real treat. The former came with a pale sauce, of which I can&#8217;t come up with any other description than &#8216;nice&#8217;. Nothing more. The latter deserves a lot of credit, as it mixed tomatoes, salsa, quinoa, all sorts of beans and leaves. One of the best salads I&#8217;ve had in a while.</p>
<p>Upon my second visit -yes, I went twice already- I ordered the cold &#8216;pollo con mayonesa&#8217; sandwich. Which basically is a chicken mayo sandwich, but again with avocado and a special sauce. I liked it a lot too, and noticed that the size of the buns had about doubled since my last visit!</p>
<p>You order and pay at the counter, where you can see your food being cooked. There are quite a few tables, from cozy corners with wicker vintage chairs, to long wooden tables. The interior features lots of wood, dark green paint and plants everywhere (I loved the hanging baskets). At the back, there&#8217;s a great looking garden too with rocky wall. Unfortunately you can&#8217;t sit outside (yet).</p>
<p>Great place, great food.</p>
<p>227, Chaussée de Charleroi, open every day 12.00-15.00 &amp; 19.00-22.30 (Mon &amp; Sun, lunch only)</p>

But I love to spend time in the kitchen, browse the web and books for recipes and visit shops for unusual ingredients. Kis Mad was on my radar for a while, and now I finally visited the shop.<span id="more-1862"></span></p>
<p>The epicerie fine has two shops, one in Saint-Gilles and one in Ixelles. I went to the latter.</p>
<p>The shop was smaller than I expected, with the most luscious-looking fruit and vegetables at the front, and condiments and spices at the back. What a difference from your average supermarket where everything is packed, wrapped and piled up. The raspberries where the biggest I&#8217;d ever seen, the mushrooms the healthiest, the tomatoes the happiest (yes, happy!).</p>
<p>As I was feeling a bit under the weather, the main goal of my visit was to find a treat to make me feel better. Nougat or boiled sweeties? Or Italian crackers flavoured with fennel or chilli seeds? Or spreadable chocolate orange? I couldn&#8217;t choose and the rack with spices distracted me as well. I&#8217;m a big fan of pepper, and the variety of pepper corns made me dream of sunny and far-away countries.</p>
<p>Back to the treats &#8230; I ended up brining &#8216;milk jam&#8217; and white Earl Grey tea to the till. I can&#8217;t wait to taste the jam (which will be sweet and sticky, like dulce de leche) and as for the tea &#8230; it was just what I needed, a hot drink with lovely bergamot flavours (that went nicely with writing this post).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure the shop will get another visit soon, when I&#8217;ll be looking for Christmas inspiration!</p>
<p>504 Chaussée de Waterloo, open every day but Wednesday, between 10.00-19.30, Sundays between 10.00-17.00<br />
42 Rue Capouillet, open every day but Sunday between 09.00-19.30</p>

<p>För means travel in Icelandic. The owner of the shop developed a passion for the country and wanted to bring some of its nordic spirit to Brussels. Great idea, as I&#8217;m quite a fan of clever Scandinavian design too. The yellow raincoat on the picture is one by Rains, a Danish brand with the best looking raincoats ever. They come in several colours and are available at För. I-love-them!</p>
<p>On the racks: Levi&#8217;s Made and Crafted and Question Of (organic cotton t-shirts and more) and more brands to come. I was particularly interested in the small food corner, where you&#8217;ll find Kvass (a Russian grain lemonade) and Icelandic salt. The furniture is up for sale as well, vintage finds from the Antwerp-based shop 1000designs.</p>
<p>All this in a space not much bigger than your average living room. You have to see it to believe it!</p>
<p>And downstairs, there&#8217;s more. The basement is used for art exhibitions and event. Great stuff!</p>
<p>108 Rue Africaine, open Monday until Saturday between 11.00-18.00</p>

Shampoos, hair dyes, brushes, extensions, straighteners, they have it all.<span id="more-1735"></span></p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t really looking for anything in particular, but having walking passed Hairdis on numerous occasions, I figured it was time to see what it was all about.</p>
<p>The shelves are packed with shampoos, conditioners, serums and other hair care by famous brands as L&#8217;Oreal Professional, Wella and Schwarzkopf (and many more), and blowdryers and straighteners by Babyliss. There&#8217;s a very large large offer of hair dyes and bleach as well, but unless you know (someone who knows what they&#8217;re) you&#8217;re doing, I recommend you get some advice on what colours to pick and how to go about it. Same thing goes for the keratin treatments available, meant to feed you hair with a keratin boost as to relax it and end up with straight hair. (Growing up in the nineties I&#8217;ve attempted quite a few hair colour changes myself, more than often ending up with me not daring to remove the towel from my head and my dad laughing. Trust me, some thing are better left to professionals.)</p>
<p>On to hair accessories then. Lots and lots of combs and brushes. I was particularly pleased to see some Mason Pearson ones as well. They&#8217;re meant to last forever (craftsmanship form London) but come with a price tag easily ten times more expensive than an ordinary brush. If you can&#8217;t be bothered growing your hair, there are extensions in a myriad of colours, and all sorts of pins and clips to keep them up.</p>
<p>More professional gear included capes, chairs, trolleys and lots of make-up to finish up your new look.</p>
<p>Price-wise? You&#8217;ll pay more than at your chemist (makes sense, as he won&#8217;t sell the professional stuff), but definitely less than at your hair dresser&#8217;s. Unlike at the latter, you&#8217;re not tempted/pushed into buying products, but at the same time, you don&#8217;t really get to test them either. Luckily the staff knows what they&#8217;re selling, and help you out when you can&#8217;t choose.</p>
<p>Note: while in the shop, I overheard the sales man say a new Hairdis would open soon near Madou.</p>
<p>69 Chaussée de Charleroi, open during the week from 09.00-19.00 and on Saturday from 10.00-19.00</p>

His tag line &#8216;recycling second hand clothes&#8217; intrigued me, but I couldn&#8217;t quite figure out what he was doing. Until a couple of weeks ago, when there was light coming from the windows as he&#8217;d turned part of his atelier into a shop. Hello pretty bags!<span id="more-1685"></span></p>
<p>Eric Beauduin browses the Brussels&#8217; vintage shops for leather jackets and belts. Back in his workshop, he cuts up the leather finds and turns them into bags (from small purses to very large travel bags). The results is a brand new  bag, made from old leather, with a top-notch finish. If you weren&#8217;t familiar with his work, I think you wouldn&#8217;t notice the leather is actually second hand.</p>
<p>The details, the fine stitching, I was quite impressed. He told me he was rather obsessed with details, a quality he acquired amongst others by working for Delvaux.</p>
<p>While visiting the shop, you can see his atelier, where scraps of leather and buckles lay next to each other on a high table. As he&#8217;s working with second hand material, none of the bags are the same. The leather could be different and the size of the pocket varies as well (often he re-uses the original pocket from the jacket, as seen on the picture above).</p>
<p>Eric Beauduin does bespoke bags as well, and if you have an old leather jacket you&#8217;d like turn into a bag, he&#8217;ll make it happen too.</p>
<p>Prices start at 180 euro, which I find very reasonable for a designer bag, made in Belgium. (You&#8217;ll easily pay three to four times as much for a bag created by a US designer, but made God knows where, and of a quality clearly only supposed to last one season. Trust me, I&#8217;ve unfortunately got one of those.)</p>
<p>229 Chaussée de Charleroi, open from Thursday until Saturday, between 12.00-18.00 (ring the doorbell!)</p>

<p>Step inside and discover a very wide offer in Lebanese delights. From the popular falafel, humous and tabouleh, to little pies stuffed with cheese, spinach or meat, Lebanese mini pizzas, wine leaves stuffed with vegetables and so much more.</p>
<p>Everything is presented in big trays and the choice seems endless. The owners are more than happy to explain the different ingredients and flavours that went into every dish, so don&#8217;t worry if you&#8217;re not too familiar with Lebanese cuisine.</p>
<p>Make sure you choose some of the dessert treats as well. My absolute favourite is their homemade baklawa with crushed pistachios. Very sweet, but so so good.</p>
<p>If you love the food, give <a title="Al Barmaki" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/p=1527">Al Barmaki</a> in the centre a try as well, to me it&#8217;s the best Lebanese restaurant in town.</p>
<p>Note: cash only, but there&#8217;s an ATM nearby</p>
<p>277 Chaussée de Charleroi, open every day between 9.00-18.30 but closed on Monday and Sunday</p>

Sit down in the pretty interior with stained glass windows and enjoy a plate of good Belgian food together with one of the many beers on the menu.<span id="more-1628"></span></p>
<p>Curly wooden features, a stunning stained glass dome, cozy compartments, and a large upstairs seating area that can be rented out for events. La Porteuse d&#8217;Eau is a real pleasure for the eyes.</p>
<p>On the menu: nothing but classics, including steak tartar, meatballs in tomato sauce, carbonnade stew, rabbit in cherry beer sauce, etc (most of them served with a portion of crunchy potato fries).</p>
<p>The waiters are friendly and quick, the food tastes good and the place is always nicely busy. Ideal for a late lunch during the weekend.. or a coffee with pancakes in the afternoon.</p>
<p>And yes, if you need the toilet, you get to walk up the big staircase and see the great upstairs room as well. (Btw, the toilets are one of the cleanest/spaciest around).</p>
<p>48a Rue Jean Volders, open every day</p>
