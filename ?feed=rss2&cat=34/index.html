				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Sounds-Jazz.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1724" alt="Sounds Jazz" src="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Sounds-Jazz-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a>Located just off Place Fernand Cocq, Sounds Jazz Club is the place to be in the area if you&#8217;re after live music. The small stage has been the scene for some great jazz performers since it opened in 1986. But wether there&#8217;s a big name lined up or not, the vibe is always right.<span id="more-1723"></span></p>
<p>Sounds Jazz Club looks like a café from the outside. Nothing gives away that over the years, jazz legends such as Philippe Catherine and Jef Neve performed here at the start of their careers. Once inside, the decor is charmingly dated. Wooden tables and chairs, red velvet curtains and a small stage at the back.</p>
<p>The club is open every day but Sunday, and gigs start at 22.00. Those who come early can grab a bite to eat, the menu reads all Italian dishes cooked by co-owner Rosy (her husband Sergio is in charge of the cocktail menu)</p>
<p>The entrance fee is 10 euro, and in exchange you get to watch a live music band and spend the night in good company. The music isn&#8217;t always jazz <em>pur sang, </em>there&#8217;s a bit of rock, jive and other variants too. A small spot in between the stage and the tables is used as a dance floor, often the scene for some unusual dance moves (like err,  how uncles and aunties dance at weddings).</p>
<p>Drinks are priced reasonably. Wine, beers (some special jazz beers too), cocktails, apero drinks, the usual. The white wine is nice (no headache the next morning, which, at 2,5 euro a glass is a winner!) Check the website for upcoming gigs.</p>
<p>28 Rue de la Tulipe, open every day but Sunday between 20.00- 03.00</p>

		<description><![CDATA[I like Irish pubs. For the drinks, the pub food, the wooden interior, the celtic music (preferably live) and the general ambiance.

<p>I used to work in the area, and de Valera&#8217;s was my favourite lunch place. Sitting outside with a cold drink, chatting with colleagues, nice. The menu at de Valera&#8217;s, doesn&#8217;t really read like an Irish one. It features salads, burgers and pasta, but if you look harder, you&#8217;ll see they serve bangers and mash as well.</p>
<p>The white wine (chardonnay) is great (and a big glass too), although I&#8217;m usually tempted to have a cider (as well).</p>
<p>The one thing that bugs me a bit, is the many tv screens, even on the terrace. But then again, it&#8217;s an Irish pub, what did I expect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>17, Place Flagey, open every day, from 11.00-00.00</p>
