				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/pika-pika.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1857" alt="pika pika" src="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/pika-pika-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a>How could I resist this colourful window display? It belongs to Pika Pika Japan, a new shop selling toys, items and clothes all the way from Japan. <span id="more-1856"></span></p>
<p>A while ago, there was a similar shop with the same name (and by the same owner) down Rue Lombard in the city centre. I never walked in the shop, but the day I was planning to do so, it was shut. When walking on Chaussée de Waterloo one day, (on my way to <a title="Bang Bang" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/p=665">Bang Bang</a>, to be precise), I noticed this new shop and walked in right away.</p>
<p>Lots of colours, lots of shapes, lots of cute little toys staring at you with big eyes. Inflatable animals, notebooks, mobile phone pendants, socks, piggy banks, stickers, markers &#8230; an incredible selection of Japanese stuff. If you&#8217;re not sure what you&#8217;re looking at, the owner and the shop assistant have tons of stories to tell.</p>
<p>I loved the little green and orange bird that tweeted every now and again, when  somebody walks passed it. But eventually left the shop with a bright red Kewpie, a plastic adorable little figurine, with wings and big eyes. It doesn&#8217;t do anything, but when I look at it, I cannot but smile.</p>
<p>Note: Everything is directly imported from Japan, which explains the price. Nothing it too expensive, though.</p>
<p>525 a, Chaussée de Waterloo, open every day but Sunday, between 11.00-19.00</p>

<p>Just look at these two stuffed animals. I think the one is a fox, the other one a mouse. Adorable!</p>
<p>Owner Valérie picked brands from all over the world to sell at her shop. Scandinavian ones with a feel for all things organic, or American ones with cool designs, for instance. The cuddly toys are from a Brussels designer, and there even is a selection of vintage furniture.</p>
<p>And even though I&#8217;m too big for the clothes, too old for the toys, I wouldn&#8217;t mind a cute vintage wooden school desk (you know, with an attached chair and space to put your writing device and ink pot). Same goes for the metal storage cases in pretty colours&#8230;.</p>
<p>And, the shop is open on Sundays!</p>
<p>25 Rue Lebeau, open every day but Monday. From Tuesday until Saturday between 10.30-18.00 &amp; on Sunday, from 11.30-17.00</p>

This one on Avenue Louise just opened (hence the waving bird at the door), and sells &#8216;educational&#8217; toys for kids from 0 to 12 years of age.<span id="more-1397"></span></p>
<p>Eurekakids is actually a chain store, by there&#8217;s only one of them in Brussels. The shop is to be found near Rue du Bailli, you can&#8217;t miss it as it&#8217;s very colourful.</p>
<p>Once inside, you&#8217;ll find jigsaws, puppets, drawing kits, &#8216;make your own soap&#8217; sets and more. Everything looks of great quality, and judging by the screaming kids, they loved it too.</p>
<p>I was a bit baffled by the large choice of kid-sized cleaning tools. Brushes, mops, even a whole cleaning lady trolley. It seems a bit wrong to give a brush and a dustpan as a gift for a toddler&#8217;s birthday, but they -apparently- love it.</p>
<p>The shop opened just in time for Saint Nicholas and Santa Claus, perfect if you haven&#8217;t got a clue what to give the kids this year.</p>
<p>199a, Avenue Louise, open from Tuesday until Saturday, between 10.30-18.30</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Les-Petits-Poissons.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1331" title="Les Petits Poissons" alt="" src="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Les-Petits-Poissons-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a>Now this is a great shop for kids (and their parents, and everybody who loves pretty things that make you laugh). Furniture, wooden toys, lamps, mobiles, funny cards, cute clothes, artwork&#8230; all under one roof.<span id="more-1330"></span></p>
<p>The shop got its name from a French nursery rhyme. Little fish can swim as fast as the big ones do. A truth the owner takes very seriously, as she decided to open a little shop with a different approach than the big toy shops around.</p>
<p>Owner Julie Gerbaud* is a trained furniture restorer. As the current crisis prevented her from using her skills every day, she decided to change course. With Les Petits Poissons (the little fish) she now has her own kids shop, a universe for children and their parents.</p>
<p>On second hand fairs and flea markets, she buys old wooden toys and furniture which she gives a second life in the workshop behind her shop. From artisans, she buys paper lamps, pretty mobiles and handmade puppets.  From a shop that&#8217;s gone bust, she bought a series of cute clothes for kids, and from a couple of befriended artists, she exposes and sells some drawing and paintings for kids&#8230;. Loved it!</p>
<p>* The name might ring a bell. Laurent Gerbaud is a famous chocolate maker, and Julie is his sister.</p>
<p>New address!: 68 Place du Jeu de Balle, open from Wednesday until Saturday between 12.00-18.00</p>

<p>Over the years, the shop has expanded quite a bit. I don&#8217;t mind at all, more toys for everyone!</p>
<p>The Grasshopper specialises in stuffed animals, wooden games, little plastic puppets, board games &#8230; basically: in everything (see how unbiased I am?)</p>
<p>I love their range of cute table wear for kids (nobody likes to eat from a boring white plate, if you could have one with a big pink Barpapapa, right?) I&#8217;m a fan of their small items too: cute magnets, keyhangers etc ..  You really don&#8217;t need to be/have a kid to enjoy a visit to the shop &#8230; Trust me.</p>
<p>39-43, Marché aux Herbes, open from Monday to Saturday, between 10.00-18.00</p>

<p>THIS SHOP IS NOW CLOSED. YOU&#8217;LL FIND <a title="La Meute" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/p=1542">LA MEUTE</a> ON THIS LOCATION.</p>
<p>And another kids store. Even though the shop has been open for a year now, I never really noticed it when walking down Rue du Page. Until that one day &#8230;<span id="more-476"></span></p>
<p>First of all, apparently I am not the only one who walks passed the shop. Even though it&#8217;s located in one of Ixelles&#8217;s most lively streets, it also is situated at the complete rear of the street (away from bustling Place du Chatelain).</p>
<p>The shop owner started years ago, with a blog for pregnant women. She soon opened a webshop with cool stuff for kids, and a few years later she wanted to meet her customers and opened a &#8216;real store&#8217;. She sells toys (made from natural fabrics such as linen) and a few exclusive clothes lines as well.</p>
<p>Everything she sells has been tried and tested by her two kids, that&#8217;s clever! Little Circus is a great place to find special and original gifts for kids!</p>
<p>92, Rue du Page, open from Wednesday until Saturday, from 11.00-18.00</p>

<p>THE best shop to find witty or quirky gifts for literally everyone you know. Endless browsing and fun guaranteed.<span id="more-472"></span></p>
<p>I just can&#8217;t walk passed this place without quickly nipping inside. Yes, it is a museum shop, but not the boring kind where you only find postcards, posters or magnets of the artworks you&#8217;ve just seen. There&#8217;s so much more.</p>
<p>CDs &#8211; DVDs &#8211; books on art, design, cooking, travelling &#8211; toys for kids &#8211; a very large choice of greeting cards &#8211; accessories for the kitchen, the living room etc &#8211; mugs &#8211; t-shirts &#8230;</p>
<p>The Bozar Shop often collaborates with a brand or artists and has some sort of pop-up store or window entirely devoted to the brand/artist. Obviously nothing commercial, always something arty. Must-visit!</p>
<p>15, Rue Ravenstein, open every day between 10.00-19.00</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

When walking in the city centre a while ago, I came across Le Wolf. A stunning, fairy tale-like bookshop with a little resto/bar for mum &amp; dad.<span id="more-432"></span></p>
<p>The main attraction of this shop is the large selection of books. Not only do they have literature for all ages, they have an impressive offer of different languages as well: French, English, Dutch, Italian, Spanish, Arabic etc. There are cute stories for girls, and adventurous tales for boys.</p>
<p>The decor of the shop is worth a mention as well. Shelves stacked with books, a juke-box telling stories, &#8230;. and a very special living room where kids can read quietly: little red riding hood&#8217;s very own grandmother used to live there!</p>
<p>While the kids read, discover and meet peers, their parents can enjoy a drink in the cozy canteen. And yes, they serve wine (should you need something to keep you there!)</p>
<p>18, Rue de la Violette, open all weel but Monday, also open on Sunday!</p>

A recent discovery is Mon Amour down Rue du Page. Even though I must have passed the shop a hundred times before, I never walked in.<span id="more-368"></span></p>
<p>The window displays vintage and children&#8217;s toys, a mix that doesn&#8217;t really appeal to me as A) I like vintage, but not for me and B) I don&#8217;t have children.</p>
<p>Once inside though, you&#8217;ll find a mixture of items in all colours of the rainbow. Toys for kids, clothes for kids as well, clogs for women, gadgets, and tea (my favourite brand Kusmi).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s one of those shops where you can&#8217;t move too fast or sudden, as everything is packed tightly together. Time flies by when inside as well, there&#8217;s just too much to see (and apparently there&#8217;s a downstairs as well).</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t get anything, as I was in a rush, but will definitely go back next time I&#8217;m around.</p>
<p>36, Rue du Page, open from Monday until Saturday, between 11.00-18.30</p>

When I was a kid, I visited the shop often, as it belonged to the &#8216;youth movement&#8217; I was part of. It&#8217;s the perfect place to get everything for some arts &amp; crafts.<span id="more-226"></span></p>
<p>You&#8217;ll for instance find ready-made greeting cards, as well as everything you need to make your own. Cardboard, felt, pearls, all sorts of paper, scissors, special kinds of glue, ribbons, glitters, stickers, &#8230;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a great place to get some inspiration, browse and buy DIY books, and get started!</p>
<p>85, Rue Marché au Charbon, open Monday until Saturday, between 10.00-13.00 and 14.00-18.00</p>
