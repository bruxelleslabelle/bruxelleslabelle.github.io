				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/yawn.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2030" src="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/yawn-150x150.jpg" alt="yawn" width="150" height="150" /></a></strong>There&#8217;s a new concept store in town. One with a very particular concept: fashion, accessories and items from Russia, Georgia and the Ukraine.</p>
<p><span id="more-2033"></span></p>
<p>I had no idea what to expect when visiting the shop. Luckily, owners Eugene and Vladimir were more than happy to guide me through all things on display. As it turns out, designers from the former Soviet Union burst with creativity and it&#8217;s no surprise some of them got picked up by fashion magazines such as Vogue. Russian Anton Belinskiy for instance, whose collection is sold at Yawn &#8211; he even made a specially designed series of t-shirts and sweatshirts with a big print of hands spelling Y A W N in sign language.</p>
<p>Spread over two (small) floors, you&#8217;ll find clothes and accessories in bright colours. I really liked the graphic necklaces by Dis/Order (the picture above is from their collection). The leather backpacks by Pleathure are pretty cool too, with their hidden zips they&#8217;re perfect for your daily commutes (if you too had your wallet or phone stolen on a busy tram or bus, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll agree).</p>
<p>The Yawn team (or family as they call themselves) are planning quite a few cool things for Christmas, which is abundantly celebrated in Russia. Be sure to pay them a visit when you&#8217;re next in the area!</p>
<p>65, Rue du Vieux Marché aux Grains, open Mon &#8211; Wed 12.00-20.00 and Thu &#8211; Sat 12.00-22.00</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/too-many-vintage.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2007" src="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/too-many-vintage-150x150.jpg" alt="too many vintage" width="150" height="150" /></a>There aren&#8217;t many vintage shops on this blog, I know. That&#8217;s because I&#8217;m not the most eager thrift shopper in town. But the selection at the newly opened Too Many Vintage could convert me: oversized woollen coats, large cardigans and leather skirts … yes!<span id="more-2006"></span></p>
<p>You&#8217;ll find the shop on Rue des Chartreux, on the spot where <a title="Origami" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/%3Fp=1944">Origami</a> used to be. You can&#8217;t miss it, it&#8217;s the shop with the big yellow neon lights. Too Many Vintage is run by Audrey, a vintage lover from France who discovered Brussels during events such as the Vintage Market. The name of the shop is a wink at the Belgian electronic music band Too Many DJs and the fact that Brussels already has quite a few vintage shops.</p>
<p>But I feel there&#8217;s something different about this latest addition. Audrey bases her selection on what&#8217;s happening in fashion at the moment, and seeks high and low for similar pieces from a couple of decades ago. That&#8217;s probably why stepping into Too Many Vintage doesn&#8217;t feel like a trip down memory lane, more like walking into a contemporary boutique.</p>
<p>I love the selection of winter coats, from classic long ones with a fur coat, to large oversized ones, leather perfectos and entire (fake) fur ones. They&#8217;re very reasonably priced, starting at 60 going up to 200. The big cardigans are a hit too, from plain coloured ones to multi-colour models, with or without appliqué patterns. Same goes for the flannel checked shirts (for men as well), as the suede jackets and leather skirts.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a selection of bags, shoes, scarves, gloves and other accessories as well.</p>
<p>While you&#8217;re there, pop in to <a title="Brocéliande" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/%3Fp=1277">Brocéliande</a> for great vintage furniture and home interior inspiration, or go for great pizza at <a title="Divino" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/%3Fp=721">Divino</a>.</p>
<p>33-35 Rue des Chartreux, open from Tuesday until Saturday, from 11.00-18.00 ( 19.00 on Friday and Saturday)</p>

I thought it would be a tourist-y place, but it&#8217;s nothing like that (forgive me dear reader, I get it wrong sometimes).<span id="more-1998"></span></p>
<p>In fact, Ponti Corner is quite a large, and very pretty coffee bar/eatery with an outside terrace looking out to the Bourse building. Once inside, there&#8217;s a very large counter with fresh pastry and shelves packed with biscuits, jams and other treats, as well as ample seats and tables. At the back of Ponti, there are chesterfield sofas and more tables. There are magazines everywhere, books on interior design, chandeliers made with coffee cups and a great picture of Jack Nicholson.</p>
<p>The place looks great, and so does the menu. There&#8217;s breakfast (served until 11.30h), sandwich lunch, hot meals, dessert and treats and cocktails. Lots to choose from, but as it was (late) lunch time when we arrived, we sat down in one of the chesterfields and I ordered a toasted sandwich with ham on the bone and mature cheese. My friend went for the smoked salmon sandwich (both were beautifully presented and priced around 8 euro, which I must admit was a bit on the high side).</p>
<p>We had to wait quite a while before our lunch arrived (it wasn&#8217;t so bad in our case, as we had lots to chat about &#8211; but our neighbours at the table seemed to be less enthusiastic about having to wait that long). Once the food arrived, we tucked in right away. You can&#8217;t go wrong with a cheese toastie, and served with a tasty salad, it made for a nice lunch.</p>
<p>We didn&#8217;t stay for coffee, but the baked treats in the counter looked very tempting. We queued to pay and overheard the people in front of us complain about having to wait too long for their food as well. Growing pains, I hope, as Ponti Corner is a great addition to the city centre, whether you&#8217;re after breakfast, lunch, an afternoon break, afterwork drinks or pre-party cocktails!</p>
<p>41, Rue Henri Maus, open every day between 08.00-22.00</p>

It&#8217;s a cozy eatery with vegan, vegetarian and gluten free food, both sweet and savoury.<span id="more-1992"></span></p>
<p>I first visited Mémé Café a while ago. It was late afternoon, I was hungry and stumbled upon the place by accident. The sandwich I ordered was no longer available, but the owner suggested a great-sounding mix of whatever was left. While waiting for my sandwich to get toasted, I overheard him explaining all about his tea selection to a couple of ladies. Such passion and enthusiasm, it was lovely to see.</p>
<p>I paid for my sandwich, left and couldn&#8217;t wait to taste. The toasted bread was filled with caramelised onions, semi-dried tomatoes and roquette salad, a sweet, crunchy and salty mix that left my tastebuds happy for the rest of the day. (And made me regret not having ordered one of his banana and raspberry muffins).</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, a friend ordered her birthday cake at Mémé Café. Luck was on my side, it was a large banana, raspberry and chocolate cake! No gluten, no extra sugar, but deliciously moist and rich in flavour. Almost too good to be true.</p>
<p>When I was in the area again last week, I went back for a sandwich (and finally, a picture). It was lunch time, but not too busy (probably because it&#8217;s a bit off the beaten lunch track). I went for a feta cheese and tomato sandwich. The owner -still as enthusiastic as the first time- suggested adding some crunchy cabbage to it, which was a great idea (again).</p>
<p>I usually have my lunch on the go, but if you have time, I suggest you sit down for breakfast, brunch or lunch and take the time to enjoy all the homemade food. Besides sandwiches and sweet cakes or muffins, there are salads and quiches too.</p>
<p>Hmm, I&#8217;d love a banana muffin and a cup of coffee right now!</p>
<p>Note: Thanks Jyl and Michelle for suggesting a post on Mémé Cafe, happy to read you love this place too!</p>
<p>17 Rue des Riches Claires, open from Tue-Fri between 08.45-18.30 and on Sat from 10.00-19.00</p>

I had heard and read great things about the place, so I walked in with high expectations. I liked it, but didn&#8217;t leave raving about it, as others seemed to do.<span id="more-1967"></span></p>
<p>You&#8217;ll find the eatery down Rue Marché aux Poulets, a couple of houses away from coffee roasters <a title="Corica" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/%3Fp=109">Corica</a> and fish &amp; chips joint <a title="Bia Mara" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/%3Fp=1343">Bia Mara</a> (whose owners helped set up Peck 47). There&#8217;s a big black board with quotes and parts of the menu outside, as well as some tables and seats (unfortunately, the street isn&#8217;t the most cozy of the centre).</p>
<p>Inside, I loved the decor. Sit down at the table or the comfy sofa, a friendly member of staff will bring the menu. Around lunch time, there are mainly salads (around 8 euro) or sandwiches to choose from. I ordered The Pecker (chicken sandwich), my friend The Italian (with salami). While waiting for our order, we picked a drink from the counter. That left us a little disappointed,  as it stocked nothing we hadn&#8217;t seen before (San Pellegrini lemonades, Tao drinks, Bolbu chocolate milk, …) We probably should have gone for a pitcher of Pimm&#8217;s, but work had to be done in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Our sandwiches came after a few minutes, served on a wooden board with a small soup. That was a nice surprise, it tasted great. The sandwich itself was ok, but white baguettes …. I don&#8217;t know. I think it would have tasted better with darker bread.</p>
<p>We left, paying 7,5 euro for a lunch (sandwich and a tao) that kept us full all afternoon. Full, but not raving. Maybe we should go back and try their breakfast or brunch? Anyhow, Peck 47 is now on my &#8216;to visit again&#8217; list.</p>
<p>47, Rue Marché aux Poulets, open every day from 08.30-20.00 (weekends open as of 11.00)</p>

<p>You have to enter the building first, to find the entrance door to Origami (located on your left side). Once inside, the shop is small but has plenty of things to drag your attention: there&#8217;s music, scented candles, clothes, small bits of furniture, books and stimulating energy drinks. A bit of an odd mix, but all items fit into the owner&#8217;s vision of &#8216;the human senses&#8217;. There are clothes for the tactile sense, energy drinks for your mind, books for your eyes, music for your ears, see? A concept store with a lot of concept.</p>
<p>The range of clothes wasn&#8217;t very large, with a couple of brands such as the Peruvian Misericordia, the French Kulte and the Danish Suit, a mix for men and women.</p>
<p>When I visited the shop a couple of weeks ago, it just opened. I&#8217;m quite curious to see what she&#8217;s got in store for next season.</p>
<p>33-35 Rue des Chartreux, open from Tuesday until Saturday, between 11.00-19.00</p>

Add great service, a bit of a nostalgic vibe and Belgian artwork on the walls … and you get Au Vieux Saint-Martin.<span id="more-1931"></span></p>
<p>The house speciality is &#8216;filet américain&#8217;, made with the original recipe from the 1920s, invented by the chef&#8217;s grandfather. It comes with hand chopped fries and homemade mayonnaise, and as you could have guesses, is an absolute treat.</p>
<p>Other classics include vol-au-vent (chicken stew in a creamy sauce), rabbit in cherry beer and sausages and potato mash. All served on a plate with the brasserie&#8217;s logo. It&#8217;s a small touch, but just like everything else at Au Vieux Saint-Martin, it makes the difference.</p>
<p>We arrived around 20.00 on a Saturday evening. The place was packed and we were after a table for eight. Making reservations is impossible, but the staff are used to the hustle and bustle, and managed to free a large table within fifteen minutes. We spent that time sipping a drink at the bar, with a view on the kitchen.</p>
<p>We all chose something different to eat, but everything arrived at the same time. Our wine glasses were topped every now and again, and waiters came to check if everything was ok. That&#8217;s good service!</p>
<p>With the average dish costing over 20 euro, the food at this brasserie is more expensive than elsewhere. But in my opinion, it was all very much worth it.</p>
<p>38 Grand Sablon, open every day from 10.00-00.00 (kitchen opens at 12.00)</p>

A small round bun, crisp on the outside and very light and fluffy inside. It has lost some popularity over the years (to the bigger baguette), but there&#8217;s a new eatery at Sablon, keen to restore the pistolet in all its glory.<span id="more-1922"></span></p>
<p>Pistolet Original sells crunchy buns filled with all the Belgian classics: <em>américain</em> with cress, meat balls with piccalilli, prawns from the North Sea or raw ham from the Ardennes.</p>
<p>There are a couple of tables, so you can eat inside (and enjoy a sweet dessert &#8211; again, classics such as frangipane or boule de berlin- with coffee), or take out. There are some shelves with deli foods too, sweets, beer, juices and the like, all Belgian stuff too.</p>
<p>I popped in around lunch time and queued a few minutes before I ordered my pistolet américain. It was wrapped in a paper bag with the shop&#8217;s logo and set me back 3,5 euro. Pricy, I know, but it tasted great (although I should have ordered two).</p>
<p>Great concept. And judging by the number of visitors (and Facebook likes), I&#8217;m definitely not the only one with this opinion.</p>
<p>24 Rue Joseph Stevens, open every day between 08.00-18.00 (&gt; 23.00 on Thursdays)</p>

<p>It&#8217;s good to see new eateries and shops pop up. Times are still tough, but who dares wins. The owners of John &amp; Rose came up with such a clever concept, and indeed … it works!</p>
<p>The menu features food and snacks to still your cravings at any moment of the day. Breakfast with homemade jam in the morning, soup or thick slices of bread with generous toppings and cake and desserts for after. The coffee tastes good too (I checked, of course).</p>
<p>Every now and then they change the art works on the wall. You can rent the place for private venues (it&#8217;s large!) and the large piano near the bar suggests John &amp; Rose would make an excellent concert venue too.</p>
<p>Well done!</p>
<p>80-84 Rue de Flandre, open from Tuesday until Sunday between 11.00-18.00</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/hortense.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1914" alt="hortense" src="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/hortense-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a>I&#8217;ve been wanting to visit this place for ages, but I never got around to it. A birthday celebration this weekend was the perfect opportunity though. And Hortense did not disappoint.<span id="more-1913"></span></p>
<p>This cocktail and spirit bar is situated on Sablon, but it&#8217;s not that easy to find. No neon signs, no extensive lists of booze outside, just a discrete plaque on the facade.</p>
<p>Hortense is located in an old nunnery (the church is just across the road). You need to descend a couple of steps in the dark and open the wooden door before you&#8217;re in. There&#8217;s not much light inside the bar, but I&#8217;m pretty sure you&#8217;ll find your way to a table or to the bar. As the place isn&#8217;t big, reservations are a must.</p>
<p>We booked a table and were assigned seats in a side room with low tables and seats. There&#8217;s barely enough light to read the cocktail menu, but with a little help form the candles (or your smart phone), you can choose what&#8217;s on offer: pure spirits or a selection of fine cocktails (rum, tequila, whiskey or champagne based).</p>
<p>The red one in the background (of the picture) is The Other Women, with vermouth, bitter and bubbly. The one in the front (mine!) is Raging Ginger, with tequila, spiced liquor and ginger beer. A delight.</p>
<p>A drink at Hortense is quite an experience. The darkness, the history, the drinks, the service (water and popcorn as much as you like) … and the prices. Drinks &#8211; as expected- don&#8217;t come cheap, at 11 euro per cocktail. But then again, it&#8217;s not the kind of place where you go and stay for hours (you can&#8217;t anyhow, it&#8217;s not open all day/night).</p>
<p>The drinks menu changes every so often. I will go back!</p>
<p>7, Rue des Sablons, open from Wednesday until Sunday between 19.00-01.00</p>
