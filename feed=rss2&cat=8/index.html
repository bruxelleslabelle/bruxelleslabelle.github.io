The Black Sheep behind Place Flagey has got both, and serves a mean burger to boot.<span id="more-2014"></span></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve visited The Black Sheep a couple of times now, and I felt a post was needed as the place got better every time.</p>
<p>On my first visit, my friends and I were after some comfort food and drinks on a rainy Sunday afternoon. We picked The Black Sheep, but had no idea what to expect. It&#8217;s definitely not your average English/Irish pub with wood cladded walls, carpet floors, Guinness memorabilia and &#8216;The Wild Rover&#8217; songs. The place is quite large actually, with seating available for just over 100 people at the same time. There&#8217;s a very large bar with well stocked fridges ( a varied choice of Belgian craft beers, the Brewdog UK range and much more). And, you can pay by card (hurray for that!)</p>
<p>First time there, we went for Fish &amp; Chips and a cocktail (or a fancy beer for the men). It did the trick. The place wasn&#8217;t very busy, but the staff were great, the cocktails were spot-on and the bill not too expensive.</p>
<p>One of the next visits was a Friday night. A completely different scene, with people dancing and very busy bar tenders. One of them suggested making me a &#8216;Tiramisu Martini&#8217;, which basically is a liquid dessert with cold coffee, cream and a fair bit of alcohol. Bonkers, but so good.</p>
<p>Our last visit definitely was the best one. Lured in by a new menu featuring burgers, chicken and fish and chips, my friends and I planned another trip on a Sunday evening. The ladies ordered cocktails (try the Bramble with gin and berry liqueur, 7,5 euro), the boys went for beers (try the Paix Dieu beer (10%), only brewed when there&#8217;s a full moon) and we ordered a platter of starters as well. Served on a wooden board, we got tempura vegetables with homemade dips, nacho crackers with cheese and mozzarella bread. The Black Sheep has a new chef who loves to make everything himself, which is great (and absolutely an upgrade from the usual pub grub).</p>
<p>We all ordered burgers (priced around 12 euro). The new menu has amongst others a classic version, the Ring of Fire (with chorizo) and the Jack Daniels (with whiskey marinated beef and bacon). Choosing is losing, and we all ended up with a different one. The buns (classic or rustic) were made with the chef&#8217;s own recipe and so was the meat. And the chips deserve a few lines of attention as well: they&#8217;re something in between potato wedges and french fries, deep fried in beef fat. Best (pub) fries ever!</p>
<p>To round up our greasy (but tasty!) Sunday, we got dessert as well. Vanilla ice cream fried in an oreo biscuit crust, a Ferrero Rocher mini muffin and a shot of Tiramisu Martini (hello again!). A bit much, but if you&#8217;re testing a new menu, you might as well do it right …. and we&#8217;ll definitely do it again.</p>
<p>Extra credits go to manager Chris and his team for making us feel very welcome and helping us pick the right food and drinks, the chef for choosing to make everything himself, and the playlist of the evening featuring a lot of Oasis.</p>
<p>Note: I snapped some pictures, but the evening light really didn&#8217;t do the food any justice.</p>
<p>Note2: Check The Black Sheep&#8217;s Facebook page for updates on parties, comedy nights, the new menu and much more.</p>
<p>8, Chaussée de Boondael, open Wed-Thu 17.00-01.00, Fri-Sat 17.00-03.00 and Sun 17.00-00.00</p>

I thought it would be a tourist-y place, but it&#8217;s nothing like that (forgive me dear reader, I get it wrong sometimes).<span id="more-1998"></span></p>
<p>In fact, Ponti Corner is quite a large, and very pretty coffee bar/eatery with an outside terrace looking out to the Bourse building. Once inside, there&#8217;s a very large counter with fresh pastry and shelves packed with biscuits, jams and other treats, as well as ample seats and tables. At the back of Ponti, there are chesterfield sofas and more tables. There are magazines everywhere, books on interior design, chandeliers made with coffee cups and a great picture of Jack Nicholson.</p>
<p>The place looks great, and so does the menu. There&#8217;s breakfast (served until 11.30h), sandwich lunch, hot meals, dessert and treats and cocktails. Lots to choose from, but as it was (late) lunch time when we arrived, we sat down in one of the chesterfields and I ordered a toasted sandwich with ham on the bone and mature cheese. My friend went for the smoked salmon sandwich (both were beautifully presented and priced around 8 euro, which I must admit was a bit on the high side).</p>
<p>We had to wait quite a while before our lunch arrived (it wasn&#8217;t so bad in our case, as we had lots to chat about &#8211; but our neighbours at the table seemed to be less enthusiastic about having to wait that long). Once the food arrived, we tucked in right away. You can&#8217;t go wrong with a cheese toastie, and served with a tasty salad, it made for a nice lunch.</p>
<p>We didn&#8217;t stay for coffee, but the baked treats in the counter looked very tempting. We queued to pay and overheard the people in front of us complain about having to wait too long for their food as well. Growing pains, I hope, as Ponti Corner is a great addition to the city centre, whether you&#8217;re after breakfast, lunch, an afternoon break, afterwork drinks or pre-party cocktails!</p>
<p>41, Rue Henri Maus, open every day between 08.00-22.00</p>

This new-ish coffee bar deserves all the attention, as the brews (and the cakes) are delicious.<span id="more-1986"></span></p>
<p>You&#8217;ll find Bocca Moka on Chaussée de Charleroi, near great Thai place <a title="Premier Comptoir Thai" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/p=144">Premier Comptoir Thai</a>. You can&#8217;t miss the place, there&#8217;s usually a black board with funny quotes outside. It&#8217;s a spacious coffee bar with ample seating near the window, at the back, on the lower floor and in the garden (yes, there&#8217;s a terrace too).</p>
<p>While you can order a simple cappuccino or an espresso, I recommend you take the time to read the coffee menu and pick something new. A Japanese syphon coffee for instance, where a halogen lamp slowly heats the water and a perfect cup of coffee is prepared drip by drip. These so-called slow coffees are &#8216;a thing&#8217; nearly every where else in Europe, but luckily there are coffee bars in Brussels joining the movement as well. Slow drip coffees are very light in taste, but so full of flavour. It&#8217;s a new way of drinking of coffee, which requires utmost precision and timing while making it (you&#8217;ll see the barista weighing the ground coffee!), but it&#8217;s worth the wait.</p>
<p>Next on my &#8216;to-try list&#8217; : a barraquito, a coffee with condensed milk, foamed milk and cinnamon. Oh that, and a slice of apple pie!</p>
<p>Bocca Moka does great take-out coffee too, and has bagels for lunch.</p>
<p>41 Chaussée de Charleroi, open every day but Sunday from 07.30-18.00 (on Sat, as of 08.00)</p>

I had heard and read great things about the place, so I walked in with high expectations. I liked it, but didn&#8217;t leave raving about it, as others seemed to do.<span id="more-1967"></span></p>
<p>You&#8217;ll find the eatery down Rue Marché aux Poulets, a couple of houses away from coffee roasters <a title="Corica" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/p=109">Corica</a> and fish &amp; chips joint <a title="Bia Mara" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/p=1343">Bia Mara</a> (whose owners helped set up Peck 47). There&#8217;s a big black board with quotes and parts of the menu outside, as well as some tables and seats (unfortunately, the street isn&#8217;t the most cozy of the centre).</p>
<p>Inside, I loved the decor. Sit down at the table or the comfy sofa, a friendly member of staff will bring the menu. Around lunch time, there are mainly salads (around 8 euro) or sandwiches to choose from. I ordered The Pecker (chicken sandwich), my friend The Italian (with salami). While waiting for our order, we picked a drink from the counter. That left us a little disappointed,  as it stocked nothing we hadn&#8217;t seen before (San Pellegrini lemonades, Tao drinks, Bolbu chocolate milk, …) We probably should have gone for a pitcher of Pimm&#8217;s, but work had to be done in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Our sandwiches came after a few minutes, served on a wooden board with a small soup. That was a nice surprise, it tasted great. The sandwich itself was ok, but white baguettes …. I don&#8217;t know. I think it would have tasted better with darker bread.</p>
<p>We left, paying 7,5 euro for a lunch (sandwich and a tao) that kept us full all afternoon. Full, but not raving. Maybe we should go back and try their breakfast or brunch? Anyhow, Peck 47 is now on my &#8216;to visit again&#8217; list.</p>
<p>47, Rue Marché aux Poulets, open every day from 08.30-20.00 (weekends open as of 11.00)</p>

Add great service, a bit of a nostalgic vibe and Belgian artwork on the walls … and you get Au Vieux Saint-Martin.<span id="more-1931"></span></p>
<p>The house speciality is &#8216;filet américain&#8217;, made with the original recipe from the 1920s, invented by the chef&#8217;s grandfather. It comes with hand chopped fries and homemade mayonnaise, and as you could have guesses, is an absolute treat.</p>
<p>Other classics include vol-au-vent (chicken stew in a creamy sauce), rabbit in cherry beer and sausages and potato mash. All served on a plate with the brasserie&#8217;s logo. It&#8217;s a small touch, but just like everything else at Au Vieux Saint-Martin, it makes the difference.</p>
<p>We arrived around 20.00 on a Saturday evening. The place was packed and we were after a table for eight. Making reservations is impossible, but the staff are used to the hustle and bustle, and managed to free a large table within fifteen minutes. We spent that time sipping a drink at the bar, with a view on the kitchen.</p>
<p>We all chose something different to eat, but everything arrived at the same time. Our wine glasses were topped every now and again, and waiters came to check if everything was ok. That&#8217;s good service!</p>
<p>With the average dish costing over 20 euro, the food at this brasserie is more expensive than elsewhere. But in my opinion, it was all very much worth it.</p>
<p>38 Grand Sablon, open every day from 10.00-00.00 (kitchen opens at 12.00)</p>

It has lost some popularity over the years (to the bigger baguette), but there&#8217;s a new eatery at Sablon, keen to restore the pistolet in all its glory.<span id="more-1922"></span></p>
<p>Pistolet Original sells crunchy buns filled with all the Belgian classics: <em>américain</em> with cress, meat balls with piccalilli, prawns from the North Sea or raw ham from the Ardennes.</p>
<p>There are a couple of tables, so you can eat inside (and enjoy a sweet dessert &#8211; again, classics such as frangipane or boule de berlin- with coffee), or take out. There are some shelves with deli foods too, sweets, beer, juices and the like, all Belgian stuff too.</p>
<p>I popped in around lunch time and queued a few minutes before I ordered my pistolet américain. It was wrapped in a paper bag with the shop&#8217;s logo and set me back 3,5 euro. Pricy, I know, but it tasted great (although I should have ordered two).</p>
<p>Great concept. And judging by the number of visitors (and Facebook likes), I&#8217;m definitely not the only one with this opinion.</p>
<p>24 Rue Joseph Stevens, open every day between 08.00-18.00 (&gt; 23.00 on Thursdays)</p>

<p>It&#8217;s good to see new eateries and shops pop up. Times are still tough, but who dares wins. The owners of John &amp; Rose came up with such a clever concept, and indeed … it works!</p>
<p>The menu features food and snacks to still your cravings at any moment of the day. Breakfast with homemade jam in the morning, soup or thick slices of bread with generous toppings and cake and desserts for after. The coffee tastes good too (I checked, of course).</p>
<p>Every now and then they change the art works on the wall. You can rent the place for private venues (it&#8217;s large!) and the large piano near the bar suggests John &amp; Rose would make an excellent concert venue too.</p>
<p>Well done!</p>
<p>80-84 Rue de Flandre, open from Tuesday until Sunday between 11.00-18.00</p>

A birthday celebration this weekend was the perfect opportunity though. And Hortense did not disappoint.<span id="more-1913"></span></p>
<p>This cocktail and spirit bar is situated on Sablon, but it&#8217;s not that easy to find. No neon signs, no extensive lists of booze outside, just a discrete plaque on the facade.</p>
<p>Hortense is located in an old nunnery (the church is just across the road). You need to descend a couple of steps in the dark and open the wooden door before you&#8217;re in. There&#8217;s not much light inside the bar, but I&#8217;m pretty sure you&#8217;ll find your way to a table or to the bar. As the place isn&#8217;t big, reservations are a must.</p>
<p>We booked a table and were assigned seats in a side room with low tables and seats. There&#8217;s barely enough light to read the cocktail menu, but with a little help form the candles (or your smart phone), you can choose what&#8217;s on offer: pure spirits or a selection of fine cocktails (rum, tequila, whiskey or champagne based).</p>
<p>The red one in the background (of the picture) is The Other Women, with vermouth, bitter and bubbly. The one in the front (mine!) is Raging Ginger, with tequila, spiced liquor and ginger beer. A delight.</p>
<p>A drink at Hortense is quite an experience. The darkness, the history, the drinks, the service (water and popcorn as much as you like) … and the prices. Drinks &#8211; as expected- don&#8217;t come cheap, at 11 euro per cocktail. But then again, it&#8217;s not the kind of place where you go and stay for hours (you can&#8217;t anyhow, it&#8217;s not open all day/night).</p>
<p>The drinks menu changes every so often. I will go back!</p>
<p>7, Rue des Sablons, open from Wednesday until Sunday between 19.00-01.00</p>

<p>Gazzetta is the little brother of Al Dente, an Italian restaurant in Uccle. It opened a few weeks ago and I was happy to check it out recently.</p>
<p>The decor (as you can see on the picture) is great. The glass structure holds some Italian delights such as panettone, grisini breadsticks, and pesto sauces. Above and around the bar counter, more pretty cardboard boxes with panettone, pasta and jars with savoury food.</p>
<p>There aren&#8217;t many seats available and making reservations isn&#8217;t possible. It tends to get quite busy after work, but I popped in around 5.00 in the afternoon and had no trouble finding a seat and ordering a creamy cappuccino.</p>
<p>After-work drinks come with small bites of ham and cheese, and if your belly is rumbling, there&#8217;s one dish served every day as well: simple, but very tasty Italian meals. I&#8217;ll have to try that soon!</p>
<p>Note: they do weekend brunch too!</p>
<p>12 Rue de la Longue Haie, open every day from 09.00-23.00</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll find L&#8217;Amour Fou near Place Fernand Cocq. It&#8217;s quite a large eatery, with burgers and salads on the menu. The bread buns are homemade, how nice is that? There&#8217;s an impressive cocktail and rum list too. Great spot for food AND drinks.</p>
<p>Their menu features banoffee pie as well, which we had to try of course. L&#8217;Amour Fou claims to be the only one serving it in Brussels, but I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ve seen it on the menu at <a title="Merrily’s" href="http://www.bruxelleslabelle.com/p=1">Merrily&#8217;s</a> too. (It was tasty, but served with too much whipped cream, also very, very sweet).</p>
<p>185 Chaussée d&#8217;Ixelles, open from 11.00-01.00 (Monday open as of 18.00, Friday and Saturday open until 03.00)</p>
